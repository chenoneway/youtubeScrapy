Deep down, I know this is how life is actually supposed to be.
You inspired me to clean my room today, sounds stupid but i've been depressed for 5 years now, lived in pure garbage land and today... I cleaned, threw away alot a shit and took a shower hahaha thank you!
Honestly what even is my life compared to this. Wtf. I've done nothing and learned nothing. And she's over here doing hundreds of different things in all these videos
Am I the only one questioning who took these awesome footages of her doing this stuff?
Every time I thought she was finished, she did like 8 more things...
Guys, I hope that you can see my comment. I'm here to tell you something about her childhood and now. As far as I'm concerned, her mother passed away when she was little. Soon after, her father married another woman. Her stepmother was mean, she was like every stepmother you've read about in the fairy tales. Ziqi was forced to do all the housework, she didn't even get to go to school usually. Her grandparents were very supportive to her and protected her, they are the most important people to her. Her father passed away then, and Idk what happened to her stepmother after that. She then quit school and came to the cities to work as much as she could to help her grandparents. She has been a waitress, a DJ and all the other stuffs. But then, her granddad passed away, and her grandmother as you all see in the videos was sick. So she quit everything and came back to her hometown to take care of her grandmother although she knew that the finance would be a burden. She then figured out how to make a video. She made the video how to dye cloth by grapes' skin and people love it. She did all the work by herself and try again countless times. One video that is making Chinese noodles, everytime she has set the camera angle, the dough got dry and she cannot use it anymore. So she had to make the dough by scratch again and again to record. The dough that was dry, she then baked them into bread for her and her mother to eat. She then said that she was scared just looking at the bread for a while. When she had some money earned from the videos, she hired some camera men, just 2 or 3, to support her. But the fame and popularity have led to her lack of privacy. Papparazi, fly cams are all over her house, she feels really sorry and somehow guilty to her grandmother because of that. She suggested moving to another house but her grandmother told that she had lived in the house for her entire life, so she wouldn't want to move. Some people may say that the videos are fake, that she didn't actually do what was shown in the videos, she just shows her hardworking hands. She really has had an unfortunate childhood, so she deserves what she has today. Please, if you find my comment interesting, leave a like. This is based on my own knowledge so if I'm wrong, let me know. You can support her by clicking the ads or watching it till the end. Thank you ❤ 

She inspired me to shoot a video of my mother ..Love From vietnamese.
I feel at peace with myself while watching these videos.
Your stranded on an island and u can bring one person 




*grabs Liziqi*
This video is so simple, yet so beautiful. So calming. 
Also, dogs.
She's already on like year 99 of her Harvest Moon playthrough lol
I love how there’s just a puppy and two lambs following her. 

Honestly. Goals.
I suddenly feel the urge to turn my life 180º and become the best version of myself
This is heart warming, beautiful,  genuinely good wholesome life - thanks for reminding us how wonderfully simple like is - and some good hard work puts everything into perspective.  Love the edibles.  Thanks for sharing
绵阳人来点赞咯！！加油加油李子柒！
我次哦，瓜子是这么来的啊
小的时候我妈妈在家（四川）也是过年提前好久就开始准备干货，不过现在都在超市买的
官方被李姑娘的文化输出能力吓到了，议论纷纷
Even a baby sheep follows her around... This really makes me rethink how I'm living.
U r a great girl who livining with u r grand ma  .God bless u dear sis in our malayalam "devam Annugrahikatte  pegalle" & u r grand ma
Miracles happens when you like what you do.
Every time I watched her video, I felt my heart was purified, and sometimes I would laugh at her funny little action. I love you!Beautiful Chinese girl……^_^
I was wondering why she rushed to her grandmother and covered her ears and then proceeded to get flash banged by the popcorn maker
The little lamb and puppies following her, I'm gonna cry 😭😭😭
My childhood is as same as it. really miss my hometown and my grandpa .He passed away last year, on the day i was on the flight back to china .
me: *has seen this video hundreds of times*
also me: IS THAT A PAW OR A GLOVE I'VE SLOWED DOWN THE VIDEO WHAT
我想我老爸老妈了！我要赶紧回家回四川 !
Liziqi♥
I am from indonesia🇮🇩
It's cute how that lamb is following her with the dogs.
、有仙气，鄉士气味濃厚，童年回憶、，回味無窮，正。
Everything i wanted
用盐炒瓜子，沙子炒花生。满满的童年回忆，简直是再真实不过了。
That food looks amazing!
Where to find such wife!
How cute, you have dogs and lamb following you everywhere. Using that outside oven you made with your own hands is awesome. That large wok is amazing. Your'e so loving with your grandma, which is lovely to see.
嫉妒會讓人瘋狂，沒辨法，有些直播主必須耍寶無所不用其極才能得到點閱率，靜靜看完你的萬言信真是無比心疼，李子柒，不要活在別人的嘴巴裡，其實最欣賞的是妳對食材、生活、季節、親情透過鏡頭的詮釋，那份美好是無國界的，來自台灣的加油！
5:16 using the Digimon Soundtrack xD omg so cool
This is the kind of life that I want, thumbs up if want too 😊
看到这个视频真的太幸福了！
没想到播放量最高的居然是恰饭视频😂🤣😂🤣
As a American, my mouth is watering.
Do not let foreigners know the secret of enlarge food please!
I honestly love, how she treats her grandma with so much respect and how she does everything for her grandma. Plus this video is so calming
好久没有吃这种爆米花了。小时候的回忆。
TELL ME  HOW TO GET THIS POPCORN
好多菜  好多事物  都是童年的记忆
小狗和小羊好可爱
I wanna be like her.. Please, its so productive and she is so hard worker
看了视频，没有发表评论的人更多，但是不代表内心没有触动，只是找不到合适的词语和句子来表达内心的感受而已！
5:54 when she ran towards grandma to cover her grandma's ears but covered hers instead 🤣🤣
会的技能实在是太多了，无论怎么看都是太优秀了。
Hi iam from India watch your vedio. I like your vedios. Make some good vedios like  this..  bless u ☺️☺️

Her channel is the purest thing I've ever come across on YouTube.
世外桃源，神仙生活。

自制爆米花真的是儿时的回忆，又怕又期待。
Magnífico!!! Maravilloso!!! Todo lo que genera la naturaleza y dedicación! Alguien me puede decir en que parte del mundo es???
I love the lamb following her. Most precious ❤️ I am absolutely infatuated with all of this.
This is really great!!! Hope you always stay health and can make many video like this. Salute for you.

Sis makes me want to live on the mountains and build a farm
Omg Omg. How many actually ordered McDonald after watching this???? Lol...
I told my son that I  wish she were my daughter!  Absolutely wonderful!
平武好像主要是产茶叶，没想到物产这么丰富，炒的牛肉看起来很梭斗，好久有空了切耍一哈( a fan far away from 150km place)
OMG Where did she get marshmallows? I hardly even have them!
Seems like she has a more fulfilling life that most of working to pay bills
😍 Awesome videography. Just wowww. Soo much soul and positive vibes in these videos. The girl is soo beautiful and has remarkable life skills. Every man would wish to marry a girl like her ☺️ Made my day 😍

素晴らしき国、中国…。。
宝儿姐！
Her cooking and Jun's cooking has this same type of elegant and homey feeling to it. It just, makes me fall in love with cooking.
真乃奇女子！
鄉村的氛圍真令人放鬆
那个牛肉干要必要吗，炒好了倒杯酒就吃完了，哪能等晒干。
0:24  so lovely so cute, dog 1. 2 and a sheep
Still looking for that wardrobe I have to walk through to get to this magical place.....🤗😍
The popcorn machine brought us back to 1960s.  A bang for rice costs 5 cents (RMB) without saccharin, 8 cents with saccharin.
你的视频让人心情变好
拍摄太专业了，这个摄影师牛逼
翻墙来看你  >∀<！
怎么有种漂洋过海来看你的感觉
I'm 17 seconds in and the puppies and the lamb following her like wtf how can this be so cute
子柒真可愛。😁
身邊的小動物超可愛~
爆米花，儿时的记忆，以前好多下来转悠的，现在很难见到这种炸爆米花的方式了
4000萬播放量。牛批🤑
i love how there are puppies and a lamb following her at the beginning uwu
看了这个视频有种进入桃花源，归园田居的感觉
I really enjoy to watch her videos! She's lovable and amazing!
I love the life and the girl!
ได้น่ารักมากๆ  เป็นสาวที่ขยันมาก  ชื่นชมจากใจเลย
These puppies and lamb knows math.  Following her = Food 
It seems she takes care of them really well
Never think about countryside life can be so delicate! 我梦想也要这样养老！

For a second there I thought the dogs were going to jump into the bon fire lmfao 😂rip dogs
Perfeição... Sem contar a riqueza de detalhes ...👏👏👏

im impresed by the quality of the video
<3
really like your pet sheep, can u just make an episode for her?
รักและชอบมากก
Haha, all the traditional Chinese snack foods. Love it!
I admire her work ethic.  I wouldnt be able to do anything without running my mouth or sweating.  The grease wouldve popped me while cooking and I'm a weenie so I'd be bitching about that.  My dog would be begging to be picked up, lambs hollering, just a country mess.
Omg 太強了！
自製的糖葫蘆 最美味
You have a wonderful life
Love her... <3

给我看饿了
Đây là video em thích nhất của chị. Xem cứ liên tưởng tới những ngày cận tết. Thấy ấm lòng sao đó.
Watching your channel is a feast for the eyes...absolutely brilliant!
When she ran to go cover her grandmother’s ear, that was the most caring and the most heart-warming  thing I have ever seen :’)
想起了小时候的农村春节，美好宁静的童年
不知为何 有点想哭 非常像我小时候的生活
好怀念那种爆米花机，哈哈
오디오 따로 집어넣는것 같은데 진짜 정성 대단하다....ddd
So, I'v requested that Netflix add you/turn you into a tv series! Everyone, you should do the same! She deserves it!
加油哦💪
สวยจังแม่คุนเอ้ย😀🙌💚💚
好想和姐姐一起生活
wtf  her whole life is so magical???
If aliens were to ever land on this planet, this is the person I nominate as human-kinds representative. Like wow!

感谢聪明能干的子柒，让我们重温童年时过年的时光！
هل يوجد عربي هنا في التعليقات ؟ ما هذه الغابات الجميلة أين يعيشون هؤلاء ؟ طعامهم كله من الطبيعة
راح اعلق بالانكليزي واسأل والله كريم بلكي يجاوبوني
Tiếng Việt trở nên thật đẹp
The part where she literally dropped everything to cover her grandmas ears and then she gets scared
I love this woman how she taste her treats to make sure that they taste fantastic ^ ^. I really love this genuine and gorgeously pure woman
Abonnés pour toi je suis algérienne ❤
四川真是个好地方
The hawthorn looks like mini apples
It's so cute watching the lil ones follow her wherever she goes ;-;
好漂亮。人美，景美。
Apakah seperti ini jehidupan di surga...?
7:46 grandma looks so cute 😍😍😍
Love granny. ❤️
I just found your channel today and absolutely love it!! I love the editing, music, quiet/gentleness to your videos. Your environment is amazing! You live a very blessed life. I wish I could live with you, be your sister and learn everything I could from you!
把这熟悉的一切拍成这样，可以可以！
Always amazing at her talents.
这爆米花哈哈哈哈
일본스타일의 특이한 드라마 보는거같네요 퀼리티 개쩜.
The melon seeds were sunflower seeds from a dried sunflower heart, I swear.
好精致好清晰啊就好像在电器商场看的电视演示视频一样
小李不错加油
Chinese Spring Festival is coming！！！
曾经在农村劳动七年半，所以特别了解农村，了解中国农民的勤劳俭朴，贫穷苦难。今日中国有些村庄依然脏乱不堪，垃圾成堆令人愤怒。

这些不成为否定李子柒视频的理由。我们都明白生活在大山深处四川农村不是简单的田园风光，无忧无虑。

李子柒不是在做大外宣。

她只是想通过自己的劳动创作，挣一份养家糊口的收入而已。我不相信她当初会料到因此大红大紫名扬世界。日进斗金。

有点夸张啊此处[偷笑]

李子柒经历了个人苦苦奋斗若干年，尝试过各种不同工作。她的成功，绝非偶然。

一万个人看她的视频会有一万个不同感受。

我看了，对我最直接的帮助就是突然意识到，自己做菜的水平差的太远。需要更加努力，用心学习。

当然，如同无数粉丝所言，看李子柒的视频，能让人的心，静下来。

很多老外留言说是催眠，治疗失眠症[抓狂][抓狂][抓狂]

更多人赞叹她无所不能。

最夸张的说法是，子柒可以再造一个地球[抓狂][抓狂][抓狂]
HOW CAN PPL DISLIKE HER VIDEOS
I MEAN
WHY 
HOOOOW
我看到了蔡小英的芒果乾了。
神仙生活！！超级向往！！
真的是太棒了，真的是顶1000个CGTN。
真的是太棒了，真的是顶1000个CGTN。
这个视频里出现了“芒果干”，原来菜总统的灵感打这来的
와...진짜 디저트 재질 미쳤네요ㅜㅜㅜ 넘나 맛있겠다...
作为农耕民族，历史上中国绝大多数百姓在过去的绝大多数的时间一直是这样生活，辛勤的劳动。
想哭 好久没吃冰糖葫芦了
The way the pets following her...is so adorable...love from india🤗🤗🤗
很喜歡看你節目, 添福🉐🈵💯
Damn I wish I can live there it's like the most peaceful place ever, and THE FOOD yum!
Thank you for Liiziqi to teach me how to make Chinese snacks. ❤
真美！
This like melted my heart. This is so beautiful. She's like a real life heroine of a drama. Her life is so romantic.
What to say I really want to visit this place
Amo Asus mascotas siempre acompañandolos queriendo ayudar
Omg I’m in love with those little puppies
I really love the Sheep
When uncle opened the corn popper Ziqi runs to cover grandma's ears, then jumps and screams herself.
This was so cute, how can I not smile and be happy😊💕
I love the way your cooking dear may God bless you

음식 만들때 자주 등장하는 하얀 투명 고체 덩어리가 머죠?  백반?  왜 넣는 건가요? 인터넷 검색해보니 색을 선명하게 한다는데 건강에 괜찮으니 넣으시는거겠죠?
这才是生活该有的样子，如果我学习也有像他做饭这么认真的话，我想我现在应该不会是这个样子了！
5:56 Lol
牛逼，太成功了，酸了酸了
黑粉不少，不过我支持你😠
Puppies and a goat as companions? No wonder shes happy af with her life
忽然回到了童年，那时中国不富裕，过年是一年中最快乐的时候。父母会提前做香肠腊肉，炒瓜子花生，准备丰富的年夜饭。
真的太感动
She's so elegant and hardworking, and there I am, hungry but too lazy to get off the couch to get some snacks
Damn..... these videos are just SO good
子柒估计没有种茶叶 不然可以拍个制茶的 不过这个就比较繁琐了😂
不管这些视频是否有炒作嫌疑，但视频确确实实在传播中国传统文化，中国人不需要崇洋媚外，一个国家自己的文化才是根，邻国日本韩国确实比我们做的好，而且做到了文化输出，举个栗子，跆拳道可以成为奥运体育项目，为什么中国功夫不可以，为什么中国只出了李小龙和成龙，后继无人？因为流量明星花瓶充斥着现在的娱乐圈，是不是功夫在传承方面有迹象已经出现断层了？国内首先你喜欢别人的文化，你就要先爱自己的文化，一个国家如果连自己的文化都忽视，去大力弘扬外来的文化，这个国家，这个民族是失了魂的，将来也不会得到别人的尊重，中华上下五千年太多优秀的文化值得弘扬了，光儒释道里的思想就够你挖掘的了，中国其实是独一无二的.
Боже....! Как Все Красиво! Тепло! Радостно! Смотришь и отдыхаешь! Прямо Сказка))))
Her videos came to my attention by my 10-year-old daughter, she loved watching her videos on YouTube. Now we are watching it together and we both are fascinated and awe-inspiring by her works, we are learning Mandarin and this video will help us to know a little more about the traditional Chinese food etc.
记忆中有谁曾为我做过冰糖葫芦，但现在她已经不在我身边了😭
رائع جدا"
Real life experience..i love it💗
as cat lover i love you bread oven!
As a Chinese,I am really happy to see people from different countries appreciate and love ziqi's video.
神奇的传统微波炉

Awww el borreguito también la sigue, hermosa mujer, hermosa vida
I'm on my way to job and the video is really relaxing. Again I saw the beauty of diligence and hard-working.
KOREA 한국 사람입니다. 잘 보고 갑니다.ㅎㅎ
I finally saw the "cannon" of China.🤣🤣
In fact this video has like 14k dislike made me completely lost faith in humanity.
Sorry, but just to tell you, the translation of "melon seeds" are not exactly correct. The correct translation is sunflower seeds. I am not commenting to criticize you but only for future reference. I hope you are well and I really enjoy watching the videos you make. I do enjoy consuming candy, though!
힐링 그 자체
太厉害了，动物也可爱
I have binge watched her videos for two days straight. So authentic and beautiful. I am inspired to start living my life more respectfully.
اشتقت ل جونغوما 😭
Whenever i watch her videos it makes me  want to live there for  ever
there are dreams in our life that are shining by different way.
人生有梦，各自精彩
صلو على النبي
By any chance the place you live is called "HEAVEN" ??
Im tryna figure out if she married, nah mean?
너무 아름다운 장면 하나하나 내눈의 시선을 강탈해버리네요 ㅎㅎ
This is the life which I really want to live

Setiap menonton selalu dalam pikiran saya yg makan siapa 🤔
Makanan sebanyak itu dan selalu dimakan setiap malam hari

Hanya ada nenek dan anak lalu juru kamera
农业是百业👍
Y'all, I would love to trade my city life with this life.
安逸！ easy！
好有诗意
Hey is there a way to contact you? I want to live with you for a week or two. I will pay!

@Gordon Ramsay, you need to watch and learn.
您好，一直以來訂閱您的頻道，看著您紀錄生活的影片，總是讓我感到很放鬆、很療癒。不知道您是否看過鳴響雪松系列的書，但您真的很好的實踐出書中描述的生活形態，很讓人開心，也很感動。
With no e.electricity, what a wonderfullife !
The little dogs are so cute 😭

You don‘t know how often I’ve watched this video
شكون من الجزائر يحبها انا نموت عليها.. كي نقلق نتفرج عليها
Did anyone else’s mind explode when she pulled out those sunflower seeds?
I love them.
I wish to have a wife like you to grow old w/ as my time comes😌👼
Блин.... почему так всё вкусно 🤤
真正的文化输出
She needs to release a recipe book!
The kiln looks like a dog sharpe. So cute
Meu Deus que delícia!!! Uma pena que não sei direito os ingredientes e mesmo que soubesse aqui no Brasil não deve ter. Parabéns pelos vídeos eu amo assistir, dá uma sensação de paz.
너무 좋아요. 손재주도 너무 좋으시고 그곳은 마치 천국 같네요..
Masha Allah
Vyri good
I feel guilty watching this video and there isnt a single ad. Some people make worst content and run ads about every minute or two.
怎么还有一只羊咩咩😄
Every thing she makes is so healthy and pretty ( I can’t say the same for America but to be honest I am ashamed of living in America.......)

ما شاءلله على حياة الطبيعة 🌲🌳🍄🎋🌾🌷
This beautiful lady originally had these videos made to promote her online store. But it reminds me why many ancient Chinese scholars and politicians chose to live in the outside world to get away from politics and reality.

I'm from China, and I'm proud of Liziqi, who presents our culture and civilization, even if who brings back all my old childhood memories in village, wonderful years, also I miss my grandmother so much. Chinese always love peace and hardworking from time immemorial . Welcome every friends to visit China.^_^

هيج نوع فيديوات يلامس القلب
Thank You for your videos.. When l   watching your videos, I am feeling very Well.😍
Who needs a cell phone when you can just yell. This makes me want to move out there😭😍
Those are sunflower seeds, not melon seeds
I love that anyone can watch these amazing videos, there is no real language barrier or anything! I wish I was as talented as her
I love your videos. I’ve been searching for diy li hi mui or salted plums/lemons
IF you want to know the definition mesmerizing. watch her
الله يسعد الي حكى عن قناتها طول ماانا اشوف الفيد مبتسمه تغذيه بصريه + بساطه + طبيعيه  اعشق اجواء الريف😍👌🏻🏠🌿
English subtitles is important Sis. I feel good to see all your videos.
我是埃及人，我有14年。 但我相信中國人是全世界最好的人。我說的是阿拉伯語，但是我把它翻譯成中文，讓中國人理解。 我熱愛中國和中國，我一直期待中國這個偉大國家的所有新聞，這是一個非常偉大的國家。
The food stock can feed a village
好看
冰糖苹果是认真的么233333
好舒服~好治愈~看着看着就想哭：为什么会有这么美好的生活
I’m amazed every time by her.  She is the hardest working girl I’ve ever seen (sure there are many others but speaking for myself).  Beautiful life, beautiful being, and beautiful work.  ❤️
This is my new fav channel.
加油
Thank you for sharing all of these cooking ideas 😁
这也太精致了
Just realised that her oven take on the silhouette of a dog and the board is in the shape of the bone, 3:22 really cute! Also grandmother's hat at 9:29 is really cute too XD
子柒我能問你是用什麼相機拍的嗎？
I love that
I love you from Nepal 🇳🇵 😉 😘
Ngon thật ae ♥️
Your grandmother has a great granddaughter, she’s been blessed.
别的我不知道。在海外上学，有一天课上旁边的湾湾姐姐给越南妹妹推荐这个视频，当时都惊呆了。李子柒也很符合现在很多人的“精神需求”，我们过不上那种生活，但还可以追忆一下那种美好。
I think this girl mentally and physically So healthy. great video

不禁感慨 这才叫生活吧
被央视翻牌了哦
omg THAT'S how they made popcorn? that bit was so funny and this entire video is so wholesome
Привет из России! Можно смотреть часами))
Two things bring my child memory. One is the old way to make pop corns. One is the old way to toast Peanuts. Before Chinese New Year, one my job at home is to mix sand, salt and peanuts to toast it.
Iam addicted to your videos nowadays.. Lots of love from India 😍
really like youヾ(❀╹◡╹)ﾉ~
This channel is really awe inspiring. From the cooking and food presentation, and the music chosen. Totally transports me to a fantastical realm. The production is really top quality. Super fan here thank you!
The Lamb 🤗
I love Grandma’s hat!✌️❤️🇨🇦🙏

I’m so glad YouTube suggested me this video! It’s for sure among the most beautiful videos I’ve ever watched. Everything is so carefully done and the editing is so sensible. I’m just in love with the channel. And the girl who cooks and does everything (haven’t found out her name yet) is precious. She looks like a green/forest fairy... Please keep doing this amazing job :)
لي جا من عند فاطيمة سويد يدير جام هههه
I wish to live one day like you.
我想起了上大学时期应该是2012年左右吧 看的日本电影小森林。都市人的向往就像影片所述一样美丽 ，以为触手可及；但我们终归是现代化分工时代 流水线上的一个固定环节 ，枯燥无聊，看不到头！这个节目的制作团队水平真的很棒！
40 million views...... god
Dear God! The amount of work this beautiful woman does is insane!! And with such finesse too... It's wonderful to see her share the fruits of her hardwork with her grandmother...
爱小柒啊
我喜歡看這部影片
Moral of the story -
Life is blessed without internet
So yummy 😭😭
This video shows the most traditional way of Chinese making popcorns, oh dear lord, all my childhood memories. Ziqi, love you.
Ngeue skuy, andaikan kamu tau bahasaku ini:(

Meanwhile, I'm all 'Ugh, I can't believe it's taking so long!' when my Ubereats order hasn't come yet
Her video's audio is asmr level.
感动

Wow how a beautiful heaven and the animals and the place looks so beautiful
That physical type of life full of colours, fresh air, products straight from the nature, organisation to every preparation creates calmness in my soul! Your videos are an oasis in my difficult, anxious city life. I love watching you! You make my day! God bless you! Keep it that way!

Is this the real life version of Studio Ghibli's ? A life so simple and beautiful nature it brought tears to my eyes T_T
واااو روعة هذي لبنت عندها قناة في التيليفيزون ولالا
Browsing the comments, this came in to mind. It’s just pathetic to think about that people in the west actually believe what the western mainstream media chose to let the believe. 

It’s not the people’s fault, but it’s time to reconsider the moral standards of modern media. With such advanced human civilization, is it OKAY to publicly and advisedly mislead people and to create prejudice and conflicts on purpose, where it was supposed to be THE equal, peaceful and unified human race.

‘Imagine there’s no countries’. Countries attack each other for competitive advantages, media are just tools 🛠  to control people to support their government. Politics do nothing but slow down the development of human.


Conclusion: 

The hard-working people are innocent. 
What’s truly evil is the few who possess the most power and most capital.
I love sweets 😍
Rasanya pengen tinggal di sana. 😱
are you a disney princess?
So lucky to live where it snows AND you can grow tropical fruit. What a beautiful area! <3
リアルジブリ
I wanna know where are all the ants when there's such a huge feast on the table?
如果有人用李子柒做动画主角，无论是宫骑骏风格还是迪士尼风格，感觉都是十分有爱，就讲一个女孩成长故事。
Sheep's following along with the dogs are too cute💕💕
OMG the oven that she made is sooo cuteee, look at my oven :’(
This video is great!!!!! I-I just love your videos OMG they are so good!!!!❤️😄
هدي لي هدرت عليها فاطمة السويد؟
У нее что, день 48 часов?
My god, I love this channel! Everything looks so perfect.
The sheep and dogs following her 😭😭
岁月静好
日本人の人誰もコメントしないから寂しいです( ᵒ̴̶̷̥́௰ᵒ̴̶̷̣̥̀     )
之前在微博看过你的视频，独自一人做徽墨！没想到在YouTube竟有700多万粉丝，看了蒋校长的文章才知道这么厉害！
I come from the same place with you, Li ZiQi. Everytime I watch your videos, it reminds me of my childhood and my grandmother. We also lived in the small and  beautiful  village in Sichuan Province. My grandmother even has the same skills as you, she knows how to planting, cooking and making some useful tools. I'm so glad that you introduce our traditional rural lifestyle to the people all over the world. And let them know there are not only Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen in China, but also a land of abundance which last a unique lifestyle for more than thousand years, and named Sichuan, also the land of heaven in Chinese. But I can't back to Sichuan because of exams this year, and your video will accompany with me in the chinese new year. Support from a Chinese and Szechuanese in Italy. Happy Chinese New Year!!!!
legend says she is a goddess.
厲害
Anyone else’s notice the dogs never get older 😲
Like Plays Harvest Moon Game . 😂😂😂
This woman is very tough, I've seen her injured several times to create the world's best content.
keep up the spirit, Sister and hopefully have a long healthy life.
Warm greetings to grandma 😊
اصبح  الجميع يتمنى  مثل  هذه  الحياة  ولكن  هيهات
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
OMG Your kitty cat oven is so cute, I have never seen anyone else.with such an outdoor oven. You should sell those from your channel.
Wow wonderful cooking and preserving....
This girl makes m feel - To go there and build a house like her...The things she need every type of trees are there...Woah!
婆婆好可爱，年轻时一定和小柒一样，心灵手巧
She reminds me soo much of a Disney princess 👑
我知道我为什么喜欢看种田文了……
Amo esses vídeos. Estou viciada. E já quero uma casinha nos mato com uma plantação bem variada pra fazer assim minhas comidinhas. Seria uma realização tão grande.. Kkk
Love mom
Os doguinhos lindos 💕🐶🐕🐑faz video alimentado eles 🐕🐶
Perhaps this is actually how our  life should be. In tune with nature, its true richness and doing some work to make it meaningfull.... and perhaps that's how it actually was back in the days of so called non progress.        I wonder... 👌🤗😆
過幾天就農曆新年了，祝各位同胞新年快樂！中華民族因各位而偉大！
Podrían poner subtítulos en español? Me encantaría  entender lo que dicen y las letras que ponen el video por favor si?
اوف من اشوف الفيديوهات مالتها اريد اعيش هناك يجننن كلشي 😍😍😍😭😭😭😭
玛丽有只小绵羊 (Mary has a little lamb). 啊不不不， 我的意思是，李子柒有只小绵羊 (Oh no, I mean Li Ziqi has a little lamb!:-)
When the goat slowly dissapears towards the end of the video. Nobody knows what happened to it.
After watching this ! I hate my life and I feel like I'm not healthy at all

These videos are little gems. I treasure each one and marvel at your life. You bring such joy to the tasks of your days, joy to your grandma and I hope and believe to the people around you. I have gained a whole different perspective of China from watching these glimpses into a way of being I had no concept of before.  Today I saw some humour in you, the little kick and jump from the loud bang, so cute. You are a blessing to this world.
Show! Brasil.

Sunnguh kreatif

全是传统的小时候的回忆和当今浮躁的社会看不到的东西，很震惊有这么多外国人点赞和评论，看到李子柒的申明视频得知，老外有很多并不知道这是中国，不知道李子柒是中国人👍，让他们也看看中国不只是世界工厂，不只有雾霾和工业…我们也有传承和美好的生活，希望为数不多的说中文的华人中国人把我顶上去让他们看到汉字评论！Welcome To China
Feed those dogs also.

I was thinking how clean is the air around her enviroment?
❤
差不多4000万了。了不起
В каком в чудесном месте живёте! Я хочу в таком же жить!
She is so hardworking. Watching her makes me want to learn all these things. But it also made me realise how much of a useless and lifeless I am.
I like how she takes care of her grandmother, it shows how much she loves her. Beautiful and fascinating video as usual!
i wish i can  have the camera which miss LiZiqi is using for her vlog.
كم عربي بيتابعها
chị này thật damdang
Man y has no one wifed her up?omg she is drop dead gorgeous and could easily be a model, not to mention she can cook and do jus about anything around the house, y’all men in China is tripping hard bruh🤷🏽‍♂️
Su nombre es Li Ziqi. Ella quedó huérfana desde muy temprana edad, así que fue criada por sus abuelos. 


Se mudó a la ciudad y vivió allí por un tiempo desde que tenía 14 años tuvo que trabajar como camarera y luego tuvo la oportunidad de trabajar como Dj, pero cuando su abuelo falleció, regresó al campo para cuidar de su abuela. Especialmente ella fue quien la crió. 


Ahora carga vídeos en Weibo, una plataforma china, ya que las personas en China no tienen acceso a YouTube ni a Facebook, etc. Y sus fans vuelven a subir sus vídeos en YouTube para que la otra parte del mundo pueda disfrutar de esta belleza.


Aquí hay una edición para responder a sus preguntas:


1-esta es una cuenta oficial de Youtube y ella se beneficia de esta cuenta pero no está segura de los otros canales.


2 - Solía ​​producir su contenido sola, pero después de recibir el reconocimiento comenzó a trabajar con un pequeño equipo para ayudarla a fotografiar, etc., pero creo que no está fingiendo la forma en que vive.


3-Vive en Sichuan (China).


Lo traduje de otro mensaje, para que las personas que no entienden muy bien el inglés, o sino simplemente, prefieren leerlo en español, o muchas razones más. De nada! :^




PD: Gracias por leerlo, espero mis likecitos! >:,3
❣️
I'm here for the puppies.

快过年了，要准备年货了，小时候我奶奶就是这样准备年货的，转眼二十年过去了，现在都是直接买现成的，但是早已没有了小时候的味道，可能作为90后的我们，永远的长大了吧！
Aapka recipe Hamen bahut pasand I
I know Chinese 上 means up 三 means three
She should become the brand ambassador of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). She is inspiring millions of people around the globe to opt for more sustainable and organic living. I wish and pray that her efforts reach larger and larger audience with each passing day and she becomes an agent of great changes in future! 

SHE IS THE DAUGHTER OF NATURE! 
LONG LIVE THE PRINCESS !

Love :-)

The puppies and lamb following you are so cute. Such well behaved little cuties. 
Poor puppies got scared of the popcorn machine. So precious
Really really like.
I think I'm a lesbian now
Can you eat the big yellow things that have fallen on the ground or are they no good?

Wowwwwww
❤❤❤
Sao đéo thấy ai người việt tn
I'm so glad I found this channel. Something about watching people do what they love so skillfully is just so satisfying. Idk how else to explain it. I love these videos to pieces. Please keep them coming! <3 <3 <3
Like. Verygood !!!!!
где она блин живёт , что там всё растёт.
hi. what camera do you use for your videos? thanks
To the new : her name is LI ZI QI, she is from China, Sichuan province. Image China map is a chicken, she stays at the heart of the chicken in the mountains. Well, Sichuan is a basin and very humid, that’s the reason our people eat a lot of chilies & peppers(the pepper is different from the western black pepper, it is a local product create tingly numbness in month) to release the humid in body. Sichuan cuisine is the most widely served cuisine in China(like kongpao chicken)... 
in Chinese culture, the intension of return to cropland, is to achieve soul's return and spirit's salvation, many modern Chinese admire such idyllic life but not enough courage to give up city life & Return rural like I do.... we only can console ourselves through the video like this
👏👏👏👏👏😍😍😍
I love this life. But.... life is fxxking me.
i’m always amazed at how many things she did in one video. other ppl will do just 1 thing in a video, she did 10 of them and all with precise editing (although sometimes i wish she will make them longer)
吧信号隔阂啊
It so sweet of her covering her grandmother ears when the uncle open the popcorn maker
Thanks. Best wishes.
好特別，做這麼多當存貨還是販售啊？
谢谢大家喜欢我们家的子柒！！谢谢大家的关注和支持！！Thank u~~~🥰🥰🥰
这便人中国古代文人终极追求的  -----  世外桃源式的生活方式
And why people compare her with Disney Princess? 
 She is much more than that !!
Where do you get Mangos and Marshmallows to do those two dishes?  That's not mountain food. 🤣
The last time I saw the popcorn maker was more than 20 years ago......that was the happiest time of every kid......
فطوم رانا هنا هههه
Didn't Chinese government ban youtube? How can she upload her video and monetize??
It is very beautiful when the sheep thinks of itself as a dog 🐩=🐑=💞
Does she sell those food?
♥♥♥♥

so happy to see that so many people in  the world love Chinese traditional culture.

What are the cooking pans made of? soap stone?
뭐지...  넉 놓고 보는 이유는?

You remind me of my childhood, growing up in a farm with my entire family....we worked the land and ate from it....it was the simplest period of my life....

I love watching your videos, the music and sound helps me relax and just what you’re doing is awesome. I’m glad I found your channel last year
Find all your videos really interesting, the way you make them short while the shooting took much longer... The video editing must take you a lot of time too, I really appreciate the work done before, during and after each video, we can feel the work through each of them, well I admire you and your work! Love you
She can totally sell what she made 😅 they possibly couldn't eat it all by themselves right?
Lovable pets 😍
I love Natur ❤️🥀

Now...that's a productive busy lifestyle. Very nice and nostalgic, makes you forget of the urban unhealthy hysteria.
By the way, those people who put thumbs downs are very ungratefull ignorants.
The way she closes her grandma'S ear was so cute. Love you ☺
我从未见过如此能干美好的姑娘。新年快乐🎆🎊🎉你的视频让我心情愉快！
Beautiful to watch the process, and encouraging. Life is harder but more valuable when we work with nature (Earth's bounty) instead of against it.
The only channel to watch before going to bed. Relaxing and beautiful. Thanks so much! Bless you and all your nearest and dearest!
Happy Chinese New year my motivated girl ❤❤❤ wish you luck in your life.
I love Li Ziqi and I don't believe she is part of the propaganda by the Chinese Communist Party that has created this Youtube video (as it also does on  Youkou Tudou where she is even bigger number of viewers and subscribers) to promote Chinese culture and the simple farmer's way of life like Mao used to do and to promote how good Chinese are to conserve the environment (though they permanently destroyed some 60% of their land during Mao's reign and killed off all the sparrows and other birds).

Even though she earns over $1 million US dollars a year with her two channels and her website where she sells her branded products, I do believe she lives out in the middle of no where that has no electricity or heat as if she is living in 1820's.  I believe she always cooks by burning chopped trees that she has to go into the woods to collect herself.  I believe she lives without central heating and has to burn wood to keep herself warm.  I believe she has no car and walks or rides a horse for miles in the woods to collect mushrooms and other vegetables.  I believe she wears these out-dated clothes all day and it isn't just an act where she puts it on just for these videos.  


I love Li Ziqi and I believe, I believe, I believe.   Yes, Disney princesses truly are real and not a made up movie.
I cleaned up my room today. Organized my clothes. Thats a big deal. You are my inspiration! I think next week I might try canning!
That old fashion popcorn machine is so cool.
我不懂！為什麼這麼真誠善良的女孩，這麼努力自己一個人獨自拍下的視頻會有人按負評
子柒，別氣餒！比起負評的，按讚的可是負評的上百倍！
我是妳台灣的粉絲喔
妳好厲害，什麼都會做
加油♥️♥️♥️
that popcorn machine!  I used to eat that when I was young, the explosion is the best advertisement that popcorn man is in the neighborhood
At first I thought the seeds were sunflower seeds. But they're not they're melon.

It might seems a bit inappropriate to ask. But was the sheep at the beginning of the video cooked? (After she cooked the meat. The sheep just disappeared ) 😂
No one gonna talk about how pretty and hardworking she is?
I think Li is the true legend. The most talented woman I’ve seen on the internet. 

By the way I think 6:52 is not a melon seeds but a Sunflower seeds.

Edit: I forgot to mention the puppies and lamb. They are so cute 😍😍
Her grandma and her Grandpa is lucky because of her, she cook healthy original food, good job keep up the cooking!! Ziqi was cute.
She's so amazing and angelic looking.. bless her and her grandma truly! 
Also, guys! She did ALL that and then did video editing on her computer like whaaaaa !
I want to go to that place.. Cz it's like heaven  😍❤️❤️
I used to live at my grandparents house for 1 year when I was 3-4th grade. We used to goto mountain to pick the chestnut. Gives me memory of those times I lived in the country side in Korea
These videos are so positive and beautiful, I would love to have a life like her's!!
Remember the xmas song?

This beautiful young woman makes everything look so easy and very attractive!!! She is a unique and extremely talented lady. Her work is always amazing and so very fun to watch. Beautiful in all aspects!!
What a beautiful faerie like place in which you live! A lot of lovely fruits, nuts and resources to make your treats with as well. You are obviously very talented and the calm, hard-work and dedication can be seen in your videos... Passion, too 😊🍊🍋🍎🍐🍑🍓🍡🍰🍬 All of the food looks delicious! You and your Grandma are too cute. 👩‍🍳👵 And the animals! 🐶🐕🐑
So nice💗
Liziqi 👰my wife hug fan ur cooking 🇮🇳
Amazing that’s  how we used to buy pop corn or pop rice. I would bring corn or rice to a street vendor and he would make it using that machine. The moment when he opened the machine is so thrilling to a kid
Her future husband will be a luckiest man... 😊👫
I love how she love her grandma so much. ❤️
Very organic fresh life 🥰
Those puppies are soooo cute!!!
💞💞💞
She makes everything from scratch and makes it look so effortless.  Makes me 😣🍕🍕🍗🍔😋
Queria sementes dessas laranjas gigantes são lindas
Damn she's good at cooking AND making videos plus she's beautiful
I like what she cook
Why is everything in this video so beautiful?  Just beautiful.
that adorable puppies and baby sheep
plz translate ingredients in English so other country people can understand
When i was a lil girl i had a book of chinese folk tale (written in Bengali) which was very close to my heart.There was a girl in that story who used to stay with her granny in a beautiful villlage of China .She too used have a gang of pet...She would also do many household chores just like this girl and her lifestyle was my childhood fantasy..I used have a pretend play just like the lifestyle of that girl mentioned in the story....when I watch this channel I feel very much nostalgic to see this pretty girl and her life....She is an amazing girl...God bless her and her granny..😊
Can't dry meat in the city.  Too many f flies.
The best girl. Your video helps me relax a lot. Thanks for these great videos. 😍😍😍😍😍
YouTube, sometimes I question the things you recommend to me. This isn't one of them. Thank you for this, this is lovely.
She's getting more and more beautiful living in such peaceful and fresh area.
Never seen such a calm face even with that much hard work!
What happened with the dogs and the sheep..??
I am convinced that she is an ancient spirit, a fricken Druid of the forest
this channel brings me peace like ive never felt before. thank you for doing these videos. makes my concrete world consumed by empty people who only have sad faces. chemicals in foods and single file lines. feel less like im here ...and more like im a place that we all should be. a home with nature and family a place and life worth living
Nature+simplicity+hardwork+camera quality= incredible video
你住的在哪里?
She’s so hard working lady, I love it
Người Việt Nam đâu ạ ❤️ cho tôi thấy cánh tay của các bạnnnn
Hi Lisiqi, you are really cool! I enjoy your videos! I'm from Germany! You are an international star of a better way of life in the village and the nature far from city, where people are lost in smog and traffic and far from the freedom to do everything themself for themselves, just as they want and need. Instead they have to work industrially in plants day by day without happiness.
She is soooooo rich!!!! So blessed. Amazing!!
看完我决定要叫小伙伴一起去摘柿子了 现在应该有好多熟透了😊
…給攝影師👉讚了！
This place looks like paradise 😍
You really looked quite a lot like MINA of Twice 😊
我们家是把柿子压成扁的晒，等到天气冷了外面会结出一层甜甜的白霜。已经十多年没吃到了
분위기 진짜 너무좋다... 여자도이쁘고 ㅎㅎ
I am a 55 year old Vietnamese who watched her every day.
She shows the world how beautiful her home country is. How wonderful !!!
and I can finish my job in Vietnam .. welcome to my house.
I think everything she makes is yummy and so pretty set on her table....
You seriously calm me! Thank you so much!
这套衣服好看
这么好这么优秀的子柒啊❤️谢谢你的视频，祝福万事胜意，平安喜乐。
I really love her....I wanna be like her....She's like the lost princess of Asia!!!

摄影也是超高标准，厉害👍👍👍
I wish to stay there. So beautiful in nature 😍
is she buying those fruits? or no one own that area? I was wondering.. the mountains are blessed for having so much fruits and herbs
好久都没有吃到柿饼了…今年冬天买点吃好了…
最爱吃柿子了，刚把家里的慢慢闷熟的柿子吃完，以后有机会学着做做柿饼看哈，
OMG!!! The fruits are looking stunning  in that sting
I wish your mountain home was a retreat! I would love to visit up there for a few weeks! It's like a paradise!
Estou convencido de que é o chinica, Ricardo
oh my god how lucky people are who lives in like this place. who says you will see heaven after you die. but I say you don't need to die to see heaven if you live in this place 😍😍😍
终于知道柿子饼是怎么做的了，谢谢! Finally I know and learn how to make the dried persimmon. thanks
Hi Liziqi. Great video. What is the title of this song? I love it. So relaxing
I want to live this type of Forest 🥰🥰😍😍
A pretty girl with various skills. Love👍👍💕💕
I even forgot what its like to see fruits on an actual tree until I saw this channel. We're surrounded by so much tech we dont even see the nature of things anymore..
Is a very amazing crib You have many skills.
Your life like a heaven😍
Wow, I never knew you could dry persimmons, I love this video ❤️.  You work so hard my dear Li Ziqi , my respect to you and your dear grandma who thought you very well !!!

Would love to visit her and cook for her. I hope she gets some R&R. Beautiful place with the most amazing food from her garden. She WILL live to be 100 .....plus. She is amazing. So much responsibility   It appears but, she knows what she is doing.
This woman lives in the most beautiful place!
莫名地喜欢叶子飘落大地的那一幕，“一叶知秋”，老祖宗的智慧，也许只是平常之物，而这一幕存在于秋实的色彩和初寒之间，却是平添了几分新意~~🍃🍃🍂

还有那落雪❄️❄️❄️，突然好想去看一场雪呢～～落雪的清晨是否是寂静无声呢？应该会很美吧～～❄️⛄️⛄️
天府之国的美称果然不假！
an almost perfect life
It is life style of dream!
This nice thought I've never seeing such food in Africa
In our country we make such  snacks too, only we dry different berries like strawberry, raspberry, currant, cherry. We call them ''qaq''
I love persimmon every time I see them in the supermarket I have to buy them.
Persimmon is so FREAKIN GOOD
좋은 체널인디 왜케 반대가 많다냐?
음~~~????
하...너무 좋아....ㅠㅠ
This is what is called labour of love💚
真棒看着就想吃😁
That is a very interesting way to have persimmons I have some but I just peel and cut them
This is a good live waw ♥♥ 
I love it ♥♥♡
Really no words describe this beauty..Like a piece of heaven..Thank you🌷🌷🌷👍

Now this is a good way to spend 5 minutes.
I love ❤️ this woman !!!
我和他真的在一个地球上？
Спасибо!
看了这个，是不是觉得舌尖上的中国有些做作 太商业了
Here is the translation: The mountains are covered in redness again. In the fall I naturally want to make some hanging persimmons to preserve it's sweetness. 
Yet again I see redness in the mountains, each little fruit fill the fall. Carrying a back basket full of persimmons, peel off the skin, dry them. This year have yummy hanging persimmons again. (not 100% perfect but hope this translation helps some of you guys)
Hi liziqui how are you? I hope fine 
One time i want to come to you and i hope that you will teach something
I love you
Love isabella ITALY
I like the girl so much so pretty great woman love persemon so much

Everything feels so artistic. From the beautiful location, camera positions, the lovely music and the editing.  It all comes together quite beautifully.
I always see the final product at my grandparent's place but I never knew that this is how you make it! interesting video!
I cant express how your videos make me feel.
where can I find a girl like that
美景中的美女製作了好吃的美食~
Her videos are all amazingly beautiful, it's like back to nature thing. Too bad, there are many thieves stealing her videos without giving her credit and post it on different youtube account as it is real her  just to get "money".
I wonder all the time how they protect the drying things from the birds and insects.
I just made persimmon bread. It was really good. I wait until they are soft and easy to deseed.
I like your house location
Now it's habbit to watching before going to the bed 🌻😁 Thanks for adding subtitles
I have been a chef almost 20 years, im glads i found this chanel, watching all videos that you've made bring a lot of peaceful mind, everything is well thought out, the lifestyle the food and the passion behind all. Great work and keep it up! Very appreciated.
so, how could you use youtube while your country banned it? is this legal in ChiNa ?

Amazingly beautiful place...
ตามมาหาคนน่ารัก😁😂😂😂
Reminds me of Ghibli Studio's Princess Mononoke!
Grandma lets have a race to peel these fruit, you win if you finish one before i finish the rest.
너무 힘든 삶 ,  하지만 행복해 보여서  좋아아요. 자주 보고 있어요. 응원합니다.
我要做好吃的时物
Love From Malaysia 😍
感谢李子柒把中国的文化传播到世界各地，今天才发现你是绵阳人，我也是绵阳人，为你感到自豪！
I just love persimmons and it's been ages since I've been desiring to see some traditional usage of them. You made my day, angel Liziqi!
This is what I call a high quality video
State of the art unintentional ASMR. Not enough words to thank you for this.
Ok ok, the best food channel on YT hands down LOL! I give in!
My life was like this when I was young in the Philippines.  I want to go back to that kind a life again.
She eating😄 while picking up the fruit I want that fruit what taste it will be😋🤤🧐
Am I the only one feeling peaceful 💖
Amazing place ❤️❤️❤️
persimmons is my fav fruit and now it's not the season of them and i really want to eat them after watching this video  😭💔
อยากอยู่แบบนี้ไปตลอดชีวิต ...... I wanna live in this place all of my life.
Thích cái cách chị làm quá yêu gì đâu ❤
I love to have her garden. :)
Amazing videos!!
I love this fruit, we call "quả hồng" in Vietnamese. 
Is there anybody Vietnamese here?
Indah banget suasananua Rasanya pengen gw kentod nih cewek yang metik buah
这段视频，在配乐和意境上都特别好，雪花纷纷飘落，一壶茶独自品，太棒了
Whenever I am tired of this stressful modern world. Your channel is one of the place I come for mental healing. Your videos are therapy for healing. So peaceful :). Congrats on 1 million subscribers.
兄弟萌，看完李子柒视频准备辞职回老家放牛了🤞
干し柿、懐かしい。心が癒されます。柿おいしそう。
She is a breathe of fresh air.
Amazing. Five minutes video can take months to make.
This video is better than all the advertisements that China’s government made😂🤔🤭
Quá hay luôn!🇻🇳😍😍😍
Persimons? Ours are very soft, and you cut them like apples, they are still some green?
영상 색감이 너무 예쁘다 😍
카메라 궁금하네ㅎㅎ
You so beautiful and cute :)))
她家鄉的柿子豐收，於是她收購了一公噸的柿子，送给二百個粉絲，每人五公斤，既幫助了家鄉的老人也令到粉絲得益，全都是她出的錢，多好的人啊！
Li Zi Qi's hometown persimmon harvest, she bought a metric ton of persimmon, gave her 200 fans, 5 kg per person, so that the elderly in her hometown and her fans both benefit, pay is her own money,  What a nice person!
We have beautiful mountains in west Virginia
Best 5mins 13 secs of my life on YouTube at university of liziqi
好怀念，儿时的零食，现在超市已经买不到这么传统的口味的
ชอบมากเลยจ้า. 🇹🇭
I’ve been to the sichuanese countryside and mountainous regions, where my family is from. The scenery is truly breathtakingly beautiful, but life is unbelievably hard: dirt roads after heavy rain, power outages in the summer, damp cold and dark winters, very poor infrastructure, old cold houses without much insulation or a heating system, brutally hot summers, etc etc. Let’s appreciate the beauty of the traditional way of life but let’s not romanticize away the hard work she and other farmers put into their work <3
I wish I can live in that kind of countryside with luscious fields of fruits and veges❤️Love all her videos👍❤️👍da bestest👍❤️👍
看到了好幸福啊，小微 印尼 二〇一九 年 九 月 二十四日 。

God... This is some heavenly content 💕💕 new subscriber 🙋‍♀️
뭔가 자연과 더불어 살아가는 모습이 마음을 평온하게 해주는 영상...너무좋다...내 안의 중국의 이미지가 바뀌었다!
なんか自然の調和で生きていく姿に癒されちゃう。映像もバックグラウンド音響にも自然の美しさがにじみでる。今までとの中国と全く違うイメージに心を揺さぶられてる…
อิจฉาจัง...อยากกินลูกพลับสดๆจากต้นบ้างอ่ะ

I am just see her health ,she look healthy,I wish I live with her.
They are so many languages in the comment section.  She's getting known to the world little by little everyday.  She should be the honorary ambassador of China lol.   Congrats on reaching 1 million subscribers!
She looks like twice's Mina🤔
I'm from China, and I'm proud of Liziqi, who presents our culture and civilization, even if who brings back all my old childhood memories in village, wonderful years, also I miss my grandmother so much.

Interesting way to preserve the sweet tart fruit! I did not know the fruit would sugar itself when sealed up. 

I love learning new things! Thank you for showing us all, Liziqi!
I’d love to experience to live there. That place looks so magical. Very calming
That's what I really admire the Chinese culture they have a variety of food preservation! I want to live with a simple life in the foraging forest:-)
I want to live in a place like this

I probably sound exactly like a million other people when I say this, but I LOVE your channel! Your talents are exquisite and your videos fill me with peace. This is a harsh, angry world we live in, but your art helps remind me that life is still beautiful. THANK YOU.
Very nice vlog I watching many times. This video. I like nature
Beautiful life, peaceful. Thank you for making great video👍
Love Parcimon. But very expensive in our Country,  Not available also.
I can't stop watching her videos! I really can't explain the feeling I'm having when viewing them. Someone send help. :')
She looks like she is enjoying each phase of the process, and it's the most beauty part of the video
柿子饼
Me: mom the fruits have rotten, it's covered with fungus..

นึกว่าลูกพลับ แต่ไม่ใช่ สวยมากเลย ดกทั้งต้น
Translated to English : It’s a red mountain, and in the autumn, I’m going to do some sweetness.

A small fruit dyed all over the autumn.

The daughter will reconnect with her mother,the son his father, and all the children will sit at the feet of the elder. True rulership comes from those pure and humble in heart,and you and your house will rule a thousand years!🌄🐑🕊

好美的雪
اللهم صلى على محمد وعلى آل  وصحب محمد اجمعين
中国でも干し柿あるんや～(꒪˙꒳˙꒪ )
ORANG INDONESIA MANA NIH? INI KESEMEK KAN YAA??
Her channel makes me remind how I used to live in the deep countryside in Japan with my grandma... I miss her and back that day so much!
Where are you from?❤💙
I love watching your videos. It's a stress reliever 😘Thanks Liziqi.🥰
I grew up in a village like this
Did she really live like this or this is only a content?
The nature already provide everything for us food and shelter but we humans make life harder for ourselves by running after thing that is unnecessary for life
Masya Allaah, luar biasa..
There is like no bugs around so clean tio
Here in Germany we know these fruit as khaki or Sharon fruit. They are delicious but do give rough teeth when eaten. But I love to see Liziqi eating them fresh from the tree. That way she has eaten at least something before editing. You need to take better care of you girl... love to see your videos and your craftsmanship. But you need also to rest and stay healthy so you can take care of your granny. I love to see you both working and talking together. And I wonder how you stay warm in this winter. I would be constantly freezing....
The fruit look so delicious.
我三年学习中文。。 所以我一点儿说中文。 现在我要学习中国文化。 谢谢您。
Very nice and so peaceful there ...wish i was there with my family...god bless you stay happy and take care of your mum there ...nice seen you like that  ..
Tidak ada yg tercipta sia" semua ada manfaatnya
The peace she brings in all her videos stops everything hectic around me and soaks right into my very soul she is a true gift from God. Thank you for sharing your beautiful life.👍🏻❤️😊🙏🏻

Hello, I'm from Brazil, I just want you to know that your videos help me a lot to relax thanks :)
drop the skin routine asap
This reminds me so much of me and my grandma where she lived in Gangnam country side in korea!! It looked similar but more houses near  but since me and my grandma live next to a mountain we would go up and pick fruits! We would go visit other grandmas house and sell them fruits and eat and talk with them but sadly my grandpa died and I had to leave korea to go to Australia because my cousin is getting married and she wanted to go to Australia for her wedding. So grandma was alone and she got stressed bad I came back and heard she fainted and went to hospital.

在油管上看到大家都在夸，而国内，完全看不到任何情趣在里面，特别是知乎和微博上，都说怎么假，喷粉丝把李子柒看成仙女，说变得商业化。好像就只能看的到缺点，明明是一个特别好宣传中国传统文化和中国田园诗意生活的视频。我喜欢我还是很喜欢李子柒小姐姐的，加油。
Pls help me to find the music in this video
Además demuestras una serenidad increíble dulzura y rilax a todo muy buenos todos tus videos no cambies eres la esencia pura de la vida en todo felicidades

I would be so scared of the fruit falling out of the basket coming down the mountain xD
I am so glad I found your channel, watching your videos brings back a lot of great memories of my late first wife, she was Chinese and she had a beautiful heart, I do miss here greatly even though she's been gone for over 30 years now...

Bh Rasane Kecut Opo Legi Kuwi ????
The Chinese way of preserving foods always fascinates me. She didn't used any oil or salt but it looks super delicious and comforting in the winter months.
这是比较传统的柿饼制作方法了，柿饼外面的白色物质是糖类的凝结物，可以放心食用，白色物质越多柿饼越好，而我就是一个非常喜欢吃柿饼的人，当然，我也喜欢吃柿子，好怀念家乡的柿子啊！

Good video takes time. Look at this Video. She collected the fruit in fall and dry them for months, and preserve them for winter. The whole video shooting lasted for at least 3 months. This is something you don't see often nowadays.
I am so sorry that she will live with you forever ilove gou and you. Viet nam .1.8 2019

เตเเเร้เคัตาจาย
Browsing the comments, this came in to mind. It’s just pathetic to think about that people in the west actually believe what the western mainstream media chose to let the believe. 

It’s not the people’s fault, but it’s time to reconsider the moral standards of modern media. With such advanced human civilization, is it OKAY to publicly and advisedly mislead people and to create prejudice and conflicts on purpose, where it was supposed to be THE equal, peaceful and unified human race.

‘Imagine there’s no countries’. Countries attack each other for competitive advantages, media are just tools 🛠  to control people to support their government. Politics do nothing but slow down the development of human.


Conclusion: 

The hard-working people are innocent. 
What’s truly evil is the few who possess the most power and most capital.
Mốc trắng vẫn ăn đc hả.?
嗨美丽！
我来自俄罗斯，我不小心偶然发现了你的视频，我喜欢你住在那里，大自然，浆果等等。
我自己从一个小村庄和一个贫穷的村庄没有这样的性质，我们在农场工作，我们的村庄很穷，居民也在这里。 我想说这个。
我是多么羡慕你，你和每个住在那里的人也是一个美丽的地方。 我想要的！
Thèm được quay lại Trung Quốc sống ôi đất nước phong cảnh tuyệt vời

Heavenly 🙏
One of my best YouTube channel,, always give me peace,Nd waoo such a girl.
Nd she lives in tottaly sourounding by nature sooo lovely❤️❤️
The air drying I would have to do in a screen house here. Too many flies here.
I wonder what would be the taste of that fruit 😋😋
You just can't believe these types recepies can be made by using these elements! It's so unusual & beautiful to see her doing such great work! Hats off lady! U r genius.
The ones I have in my field can't be eaten until a good frost or they are nasty. I love making persimon cookies with them. I add hickory, pecan and black walnuts from our not trees. I call them Ozark cookies since most of the ingredients I gather from my yard.
Có  ai Việt nam vào ko

今年もそろそろ干し柿の季節になりましたねえ。我が家の周囲にも大小さまざまな渋柿が沢山なっています。
こちらではまだ少し温かいので後一月ほどして霜が降りるようになったら干し柿を4～500個吊るします。
Aaaaah!!!!! ......
  I want to eat persimmons . I haven't even seen one in real life
how to do you keep the food you tie up safe from the bugs getting to them?
Where do you live??
Where can I sign up to help her carry all her fruits and veggies?
I could easily state this about all of these videos, but this one definitely is one of my absolute favourites!!! I love the background music; I wish I had something like this to listen to for hours! :)
外出打拼的異鄉遊子們，雖然現實生活無奈要離鄉背井去工作賺錢 但也別忘了在故鄉守候等著孩子回鄉的親人，有空常回家去探望吧，珍惜有親人遠在家鄉守候的溫暖，祝平安幸福
So peaceful, it seems like a dream World. But it is real and amazing.

I would absolutely LOVE to live where she lives. In the mountains, not too deep in the woods, a calm scenery.....YAAAAASSSSS. I bet she's some kind of nature spirit. Or maybe shes a goddess. Yup. She's the ancient goddess of nature who never ages.
Honestly I want to live there😂😍😍

老太太真不容易，这么大岁数了不用戴眼睛竟然还能削出这么漂亮的皮，手不抖。但愿老人家身体健康，长命百岁，这样柒姐才可以专心制作视频。
hồi năm ngoái xem kênh hình như kênh này tên là lý tư thất phải k nhỉ.   mình còn vào cả group trên face book nữa cơ.
無憂無慮，詩意盎然的恬靜鄉間生活，是她視頻受歡迎原因。Carefree, poetic and quiet country life is the reason why her video is popular.

I make candied persimmons in the fall. They last all winter.
I like the way Ziqi dries them, and how grandma peels them too.
She has all Spirits  🌟  of her Ancestors  pass to her.
Wow u're very pretty and smart. U are so creative and inovatif. I like ur videos bcs that's very aesthetic views in there
I used to enjoy these videos, but the more I see people idealizing this as anything close to reality the more I get pissed.
I never see any flies near the food

I watch these videos. They are so beautiful. I do think however that there is a big crew helping her behind the scenes.. There is no way that she could do all that so gracefully and fast. It takes days to prepare all she does in her  few minutes videos., Go to the forest ,pick up food, clean  cook and then clean again  all looking  so pretty haha. The videos are beautiful  but a big fantasie  It takes days to do what she does in her few minute videos.
This is the only channel that I have subscribed & pressed the bell button & commenting also 😊
Tengo miedo que esta mujer un día cosine a la abuela😊🥰🥰😂😂
Amazing
The Blue color and mountains remind me a wee bit of Huangshan. Beautiful, magical place, when it is not over ran by people.
While it looks fantastic, actually working the land and being self sufficient is really hard work. 

Especially when you have to fight of an army of slugs. They are eating everything i grow.
Do not want to go the toxic route. !!!!!



I still love you baby. 😉😘 😘 😘
你好
I have two persimmon trees in my back yard. This year the trees bore so much fruits and I sent them to my friends all over USA. I think I know what to do with them next seasons. Thank you for sharing.

Translation for her poetic Mandarin meanings :

Witnessing again the hills in red,
Small little fruits have spread their colour across the fall season,
Plucking a basket of persimmons,
With their skins peeled off and air-dried,
Tasty little dried persimmons are again ready for this year.
That is so cool 😎

Where is this beautifull place
💔💔💔
Thank you for your recipe. You know, in my country (France) there's plenty of those fruits, we call them "KAKI". But they rot on trees each year, 'cause people no longer eat them. Your channel enchants me by beauty of the videos, the serenity that comes out from them, the effort that makes sense, or gives meaning to life. God bless you and your people my dear.
Who wants be that lamb, then you can follow her everywhere.

Your videos remind me of childhood with grandparents. I also come from Sichuan, everything looks similar with your village,  the mountain, the rain fog, and mother tongue. Really miss the most beautiful memory.

Wish I could do this, but I have a big insect problem where I live. Can't even eat something outside without something landing on it and trying to burrow...
每次视频快结束时的往期节目推荐遮挡的画面太多了，严重影响观看体验。即使要保留也应该缩小、并放到上方的角落而不是下方的关键位置。希望频道管理者能改善，谢谢！
Again and again I watch this video..it's too cute and made me relax..
I wonder who downvoted this video?
I like to eat persimmon fruit
Fruit is very expensive in Bangladesh.....
Great editing! These videos are beautifully done.
She makes such inspiring videos
Hồng ngon quá
I LOVE YOU❤🧡💛💚💙💜

Mujhy video dykh kar bhut relex feel hota h
Just wondering....what happened with the rest of the fruits she didn't pick up, she just take as much as she needs. Normally other people will take all to sell in the market....but those plenty...abundantly....who cares?


So cute the way of peeling fruits between her and her grandma...just different!


So smart how she left a bit of stalk to be tied the fruits with string, then hang them like house decoration.
أمنية حياتي أعيش دي العيشه
You're videos are wonderful & beautiful. Even though there are no words ever spoken, it draws you in and transports you to another time and place. Unfortunately I live in a congested city with too many people, so this is a nice escape. Congratulations on your million subscribers. 
Many blessings to you and your family from Florida, USA.
I`ve seen many videos in this channel. Whats a energetic woman are you miss. Salute from me. Malaysian
Most of us here agree that it would be a dream to live her life, but let's not forget that what she has now is all the outcome of really hard work. This kind of life is not suitable for everyone because of the labor that comes with it. She is amazing. Let's not forget also how old she is (maybe 29 if I'm not mistaken). She is very young and capable of doing all of this.  It's like an ancient spirit reincarnated in the body of a young beautiful woman.
So Beautiful  ....
I like persimmons so much.
Sống như c này thì chẳng còn cần j nia
Where is this place..i wanna go
Как люблю сушенную хурму💖💖💖👍👍👍👍👍

最讓我驚訝的不是剪輯，不是配樂，甚至不是顔值。是耐心。每一個片子的素材時間跨度都很大，這中間真的很容易出岔子，除非對素材的把控非常了得。
Very good, thanks so much all video

Which fruit is that?
The videographer and the editor deserves so much credit for her videos. They’re the unsung heroes ☺️
Alguien sabe como se llama la fruta? .
Good work to you
Nada mejor que vivir rodeado de la naturaleza, en mi querido México también se disfruta de eso, sobre todo en los pueblos rurales.

Nothing better than living surrounded by nature, here in Mexico, we experience that but in small villages away from city.

Greetings from Mexico.

I love dried fruits - those seems to be very sweet - when they are dried, the fruitsugar cames out and lay on the outside skin , just like plums - i really want to taste those...

I used make dried persimmons in Japan. We call them hoshi-gaki (干し柿) there. They are made with the kind of persimmons called Shibu-gaki (渋柿) which not for eating raw like she did here.  I love them both fresh/ripe Kaki (柿) and dried one.  Dried oneshiitake are unbelievably sweet and rich.  Thank you for the beautiful video!  This stirs up the happy memories and nostalgia for me.
Please keep wordings in video in english
i also recommend u to watch her another vedio "纸墨笔砚"，maybe translated "paper and ink writing bush and ink stone".Li Ziqi paper a few years to make this vedio, she taked some great masters in China as teachers to learn how to make the best calligraphy tools. Some skills is very difficult, she is not only enjoy her life ,she is also enjoy the new kmowledge, she is still a persevering girl. i love her .

Love you
All life has it's rewards, Li, truly shows a non materialistic lifestyle, a down to earth simplistic caring for what she harvests for her and her elders. I love this woman's appreciation, respect, confidence, caring, harmony, natural beauty, compassion, love, attention to detail, she has won my heart, though we will never meet. Angel of the Orient, be yourself.
You are a drug I Am addicted yours video

看了四个多小时的评论加视频。真的是很少见，负评几乎没有，至少我看到的。很多东西我不感到惊奇，我小时候，我们那也会做好多好多玩意儿，吃的啦，用的啦。不过到我们这一辈就没人会拉。柒爷确实好厉害，什么都会。而且视频拍摄的都好好，几个小时看下来觉得很放松。今天下午还很烦躁来着，这会儿内心很平静。明天还有面试，希望能顺利！
Я одна штоль тут русская?

I've seen these "dusty" looking persimmons in the store before and never knew it was a layer of sugar that developed from drying them. My family had a persimmon tree growing up. My grandpa and I loved eating the soft squishy ones but the crunchy ones were also very tasty!
i love You lizi
I love your grandmother,  greetings from Mexico.

I am a 3rd generation Chinese from my maternal side and a second generation Chinese from paternal side. And although my parents are still deeply rooted to their relations in China and visit her regularly, I have a somehow biased view of China , especially the rural after growing up only knowing English. My impression of rural China is certainly upped x100 after seeing your videos..Thanks so much for showing me the beauty of China and I plan to visit my roots soon.. Love, Malaysia...

مذهلة ورائعة
Does anyone know can you store other fruit with this method or does the fruit have to have as much sugar as persimmons do in order to develop the white sugar coating? We don’t have persimmons growing where I live but I’m wondering if apples or plums would do the same thing, or do they not have enough of their own sugars. I’ve never seen this done before but she’s inspired me to try if it will work on the fruits I have access to.
After death we want to go to heaven.. But   she  is all ready living in  heaven.  Then whr she will go after her death... I wonder
Your video is beautiful
Just reminds me so much of my sweet wife...I am blessed. Our three children love it when Mama cooks traditional Chinese foods...Make extra rice.
omg those fruits are sooo good if you ever go to china, you neeed to eat them!!
This is the busiest woman on the planet. So gratifying I bet
I Love you😘😘

em ấy xinh thật
등에 진 감의 무게가 아무리 생각해도 이십키로는 넘을것같다 예쁜얼굴에 무쇠그릇도 번쩍번쩍 들고 정말 대단히 강인한 그녀 
동화책에서 빠져나온듯한 아름답고 청순한 옆모습에 구독하기 시작햇는데 보면볼수록 놀랍다 
다부진손으로 만들수없는 것은 무엇일까  손놀림이 얼마나 정확하고 재빠른지  .. 저렇게 탐스러운 곶감은 보다  또처음 본다  아름답고  평화로운  영상속에 그녀의 땀한방울 한방울이 배어있는것같다
Trái hồng nhiều quá sao mà nó ngon vậy 😋

The videos are all thoughtful and beautiful to watch.  I know I'll never be able to do half of this stuff, but I've watched and tried a couple of things and it is nice to do things yourself.

一種老祖宗的智慧，傳承的美好，受益良多
I like how feminine and strong and disciplined she is.
There’s something so serene and beautiful about the way she works
Me: I need new sofa. *Goes to IKEA*
Her: I need new sofa. *Goes to forest*
I feel like even her grandma is amazed by her granddaughter’s many talents.
i am thoroughly convinced she is a forest spirit living with an old tree spirit
Thank you YouTube recommendations I didn’t know I needed this in my life
Girl oh my god you're a straight up renaissance woman
Today we have been gathered here by YouTube recommendations. 






God bless the algorithm.
Watching your videos makes me want to become a better person...
she’s really out here living the dream. wish i could live in a place as beautiful as that
绝了 😭
The product is so pure and perfect.
Love from india
Amazing! She is very talent and strong !
New friend here..bamboo is also using different furniture here in the Philippines..
Those dislikes are from expensive, poorly made furniture shops
奶奶笑的好可爱啊！！充满了对孩子的爱！
Да бамбук хороший материал для творчества. Жаль в России он не растёт
5:53, she rubbed the needle on her head to reduce friction of the needle.
她应该多带几个徒弟  然后去卖这种产品
She's disciplined, independent, and beautiful, truly someone to look up to



Wth, 1.1k likes?.... What about the other I thought went forgotten in the comments? 😂
神仙姐姐下回做这种带刺的活，最好戴个手套，容易划伤手❤️
This young lady is an inspiration. You can do anything. Just put your mind into it and work hard at it. You will succeed. Beautiful work!!!
She is very attractive and makes it look easy. I would have taken 10 times longer with power tools. I love bamboo its a great material. We should grow it in north america she can teach me how to make stuff. I even hear of bamboo clothing. There are a lot of great bamboo videos out there.
<3 te casarias conmigo <3
She reminds me of a character from some Ghibli movie, disciplined and focused, living in a beautiful environment.
3:07  婆婆：你还不睡瞌睡蛮？   李：嗯，我把这个弄完咯就睡     Don't you go to bed?   emm,I'll go to sleep after this
中华民族的勤劳善良在她身上淋漓尽致，同样的年龄身为男士也不得不佩服。
I miss my mawmaws. They're both gone now. Really wish I had a grandmother to make furniture for...
好像小深深儿 第一眼就觉得 是姐妹吗
I need a bamboo forest with some foggy atmosphere.
And sunflowers.
Definitely
i like ending when Grandma come on.
How can I survive in rural village😂
The chair made of bamboo is very environmentally friendly, especially in summer, it is very cool to sit on and air conditioning is not  needed
Wow china is such an amazing country, I love china!🇨🇳❤️
Makes furniture out of bamboo
Ikea: am I a joke to you?
奶奶笑得真开心，哈哈 her grandma so cute.
太有才了
竹とか木の音っていいよな。落ち着く
兰心慧手, 方寸之间, 创造无限的诗意和温情! 祝福勤劳善良的你!
this video has the quality production of a drama on tv. lowkey was expecting some kinda story to happen. 


also this girl is hella talented wtf
高手高手，必须关注！！！
此视频引起舒适！！
Amazing! Loved it! Great skill and craftmanship
Just found out about Ziqi. Watching over 20 of her videos and I can’t help feeling pitiful of my own life.  Need to learn from this angel and determined to become a better cook. To start with.
Can we talk about how this was filmed?!! Such an amazing story telling experience.
I hope have wife like u.
还有啥是小姐姐不会做的啊啊啊啊啊太厉害了
子柒👍👍👍你真棒！做好自己祝你日日是好日❤️
👍这个年代，这种手艺几乎没人会了。
May your hands always be busy ,may your feet always be swift,and may you stay forever young.
哇 好厉害👍 谢谢你带给我们传统的工艺！
This video made me sad about myself first, then made me laugh when her grandma slowly came and joined her to have a tea. This is amazing video, amazing life style, amazing girl. She made a life that nearly most of us can only dream but never dare or able to live.
The biggest problem is the using of fresh bamboo. It would be very easy to crack or warp. But still very impressive! Thanks Ziqi and always support you.
最唔柒既柒字，respect
When I watched I was so surprised at how skillful she was. Her abilities are truly amazing.
فعلا شغل جميل ❤❤🌹
Is there something you aren’t able to do?
你好嗎我親愛的朋友
중국에도 이런 분이 있었구나
왜 중국은 유튜브를 막아서 널리 펴지질 않았나?
Bamboo is incredible.  Also, she's so skilled!  What an engineer!
that was amazing !! i love bamboo...i would love to be able to build a set like that !!!!
え？ちょ…何この美人さんは？！
なんか物作りの職人さん！？
背景音乐名字是什么？
匠人是最让人佩服的，网上查了一下这位博主好像不是纯粹的匠人。不过现在还能做这种复古的东西也够厉害了不服不行。
I hate when ppl reduce her only to a cooking channel. She's an engineer, a homemaker, the ultimate DIY channel imo
古风犹存，符合古典女的楷模
中国需要更多的李子柒
Wow! You are very impressive. The video was beautiful and relaxing to watch even though you are working so hard.
You remind me of a friend in school that is cute beautiful and smart
Not to sound dramatic but being an artist and seeing her work until the sun came down , I cried,  I love how art can make us forget about everything around us and in the end that work created something really beautiful.
每个程序做一点，最后串起来，这样就完成了。完美剪辑！！！
Here I am, building Ikea furniture...
I think those trees and flowers around her, they were all looking at this amazing girl doing those amazing things just like us!
if you in India your talent all over news channel.
I swear this is the last one, I need to stop keep click more....
이 영상은 대체 뭔데 보고만 있어도 힐링이 되지..
I like the design, really smart
跳上去哈哈两声，真可爱啊！
Liziqi: I’m not as strong as you

IKEA: No, you’re stronger
看她的视频，会有一种岁月静好的感觉
헐...뭐지???  이분 진짜 이케아로 가야할듯...
Я влюбился в эту девушку 😍
Does everyone realize she's using the same cleaver to cut down the bamboo and cut it up while she cooks with it?


dang, she's impressive, bamboo isn't light.
She is *literally* a strong, independent and a skillful woman. Each video make me more amazed and she inspires me into doing such stuff but I'm sure I'll continue doing nothing and just keep watching her videos.
李子㭍仙女🧚‍♀️我也想起我小時候村子裡的老人家們都用來竹來做家具，你很厲害👍
ป๊าดดด..เธอคือ = =>  วิ ศ ว ศิ ล ป ก ร
อาเหล่าม่า.มาตอนจบทุกครา..ปายยย
I watch this video again and again,
Surprised and amazing the young girl is able
To do such a thing.l become her fan club since then.
不知为何 这视频看得我想哭
When society collapses, this lady and her family will be living the high life
Damn! Shes beautiful and she builds stuff! A construction worker's dream girl.
shes already a millionaire.. in talents😍
I don't thinks she make that by herself
I don't thinks she make that by herself
Her videos make me want to drop everything,  move to rural China and make my own everything
佩服，太有才了。
Gadis cantik pintar lagi kreatif 👍
Oh, bamboo! I can make shampoo!
사람이 저리 완벽할수 있는건가?
이번이 마지막 놀람이기를 바란다
Bamboo is like the Ikea of nature
in one word  ... SELF RELIANT ... traditions passed to the next generations , if you noticed nowadays the finish products are run after time  ... just like in movie IRON WILL the  signature of Will Stoneman's father was affixed to his craftsmanship or i should look at our houses today compared to even as far as way back Spanish era they are still standing today for i saw many of these around  ... carpenter call this de mitsa  ... yung bakod na bakal ngayon naka welding noon de mitsa rin at matibay parang sinulid pag isa lang alang tibay pero pag pinagtahi tahi mo na ANG TIBAY parang sapatos na pareho ang tatak ... your amazing Mam and good afternoon too one of many NATURE'S BEST
除了卧槽，我还能说什么
I'm in love......
Cute girl's cute work
Love you
Internet: *builds stuff with ramen noodles*

才女 ，心灵手巧！
Is there anything this woman can't do?? I'm so amazed by her talents and skills
好厉害！
Amazing....just wonder who took the video for you :)
She makes a video by her self and I'm just like WOW AMAZING!!  I love you LIZIQI from Malaysia ❤
好恬静，好舒服，好温暖
I like how this was randomly in my recommended box, thanks YouTube
小姐姐太太太棒了👏👏👏试问能有多少人能做到她这样
可愛いという次元を超えている。
もう美しいという領域
Estava com saudades de assistir seus vídeos, é uma paz indescritível observar seus movimentos.
If you practice lashing it together with short sections of cord, you'll eventually become a gung fu master.
Here's the translation:
I have been wanting to buy a sofa set but a good eye catching set costs over 10k RMB. Then last week I remembered my grandpa made a sofa set before. So I took his idea and try to make it. This is bamboo season, ideal to use to make a back basket, a chair and a rack and will not get infested with bugs. I made a back basket, a folding fan and a tray before but never made a sofa set. I made a lot of mistakes but with trial and error I finally made a monk bed, an empress chair and a tea table. Very happy, very happy. Coming from a smilely person who just saved a ton of money.
When you write content Creator on your resume this is what you mean! 🤪🤪 This woman is amazing!!
李子柒，你知道你现在有多火吗？全国人民都在讨论你哦，说是第一网红都不为过，继续好好的做视频吧。👍
Your too cute😱❤️
Beautiful sound, beautiful furniture and what amazing talent
When I saw the thumbnail few days ago in my recommendations, I thought maybe its some sort of short clips of drama videos so never clicked. I wasn't expecting this... She is so cool...
People are saying , she is just a actor.  

If you watch enough of her videos you may be convinced that she did all the work herself.  

Let’s talk a little further.   Assuming it’s a 3 mile walk and 5 strong men carried those bamboos for her and hide behind the camera.   

So what?  Ziqi can afford hiring any number of people as she pleases.   In fact if she says she allows volunteers to be there helping out, guess how many people would be willing to go!  

My wife and I would go and get educated there just being around her and learn doing things from her.   

I would assume she did it by herself since it maybe only less than a mile from home.

A suggestion to her: you don’t have to do everything yourself now and please feel free to use as much help as you wish.   People in China need jobs and income!  And, they love to work for you.

At this point,  Ziqi quite earned everything and deserves all the attention through her hard efforts of many years.  

See how much attention I am paying to her?  In the last 3 days, I spent at least 20+ hours watching and writing and reading everything related to her videos.

The beauty of my obsession is,  I get motivated and want to become a better father, better husband, and, a better COOK!  

let us all appreciate that she suffered so much misery earlier in her childhood and survived, and now, shines,  due to her resilience and,  see how smart she is in everything she dose?

Ziqi is THE most beautiful person I have seen on YouTube, inside out.  

Wish I knew all about her earlier and Ziqi has our utter, absolute and unqualified love.   We wish her happiness and all her dreams come true.
愛しています
これは、、、えぐいてえ！！！！
Absolutely awesome. I would love to go live with her for a year and learn all of this stuff. Would be so much education. Just amazing
She heated and bent the bamboo
Me: WHOA! 😮
Totally learned something new today 😊
i love your Mom.
She is very proud of you.
This is called as pure art..... something that you done with your own thought......
صدق ذي الي تستاهل واحد يتزوجها سنعه وتضبط امورها 😂🚶🏻‍♂️
What a lovely girl, what a smart girl!
Wow. This is like life goals for me here. This girl's a gorgeous, intelligent, disciplined, and skilled engineer. THIS GIRLS ON FIRE!! Keep it up. You gotta new subscriber!
我滴神啊！
I want to go make furniture with this beautiful lady, so calm am peaceful she looks while working x
锯子不专业，锯竹子是不用钢锯的，别问我怎么知道的。
單單這個視頻打趴了99%的中國男人
All lovely and well crafted, the furniture, the setting, camera work, music. Thank you so much.
In ancient China, people did not have nails, so our ancestors used those very magical physics structures to make furniture and buildings. When modern physics was imported to China, scientists are still feeling amazing of the ancestors' wisdom
You are a fantastic woman. Love your skills and ways and share in some of them. Thanks for the great videos, this is my second to see. Sub'd
听说你很火，来看看
i have watched  it a million times and i always feel caml and satisfied after watching it. LOVE ITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT..............
I was like: "how will she bring these bamboos home?"
And  then she freaking dragged those damn bamboos home 😵 she is so amazing
姑娘长得漂亮还有这么好的手艺，能娶到这样的媳妇在梦中也会笑，哈哈哈😄

顺便问问，竹子没晒干就做了成品，会不会松垮垮的？竹子干了会收缩的，包那个缩当然是好事，被包那个一样缩，收缩不同步坏事就来啦，搖摆姿势。经验分享一下，哈哈哈😄
李子柒我会永远支持你，爱你❤️
배경음 너무 좋고.. 여자분 너무 아름다우시공.. ㅠㅠ
天呐我家从前也有竹床藤椅，就是这么做的！

Her and her grandmother are so precious I’m gonna cry. 

Also she is so gorgeous wtf how??

原来都这么火了，加油
This was amazing and it was strangely calming to watch she is really cool and I love how she cared so much for her grandma
first video i've watched from this channel and i'm very impressed!
点踩的人一定是心理变态的！
虫叫鸟鸣，敲打竹子的清脆，还有偶尔和奶奶的几句喃喃，就很治愈了，还有这么精选的音乐和女公主...
Wow sure a beautiful lady making this I'm surprise u r really talented like it those u love her video
Was expecting her to fly through the bamboo forest on the way back.
Twice Mina during down time

She's like the perfect woman.. in the perfect place

She is a beautifull girl. I like it work with bamboo. Thank you.
Eating what u grow = amazing
Having tea on a freashly made bench made by you = next lvl
Multi-talented she is a real Prince's
一看这么嫩，这么白的小手，那就不是做事的手
太能干了吧！好想跟她学！！
一次扛  四个竹竿  太强大了
Madam, I'm both humbled and hypnotized by your skill, craftsmanship, art and beauty.
Amazing. Simply impresseed.
我身為男子漢，自問家居水電樣樣精通，但看見李姑娘的手藝，真心甘拜下風
The character on the pillow is her first name, meaning seven, written in a traditional form.
钦佩和喜欢的难以言语
And here I am still trying put together this ikea piece
Outstanding work dear Good Job...😍😍
her granny looks so proud it makes me happy
I admire you so much. This is the life I want. China is beautiful
Didn't she like take only 3 bamboos?..
Anyways i trying to put my 2 by 2 lego piece here!

You are always amazing~~

People amazed by her talent,
Me wondering how she uploads video in youtube from china!!!
She’s literally one of the most talented,creative,strong and inspiring women that I have ever seen a real superwomen🤗Love her❣️
Wow incredible woman..she has all the talents and beauty
這太扯了自己做的😱
idol,  i actually want the furniture tho ngl
这些竹制家具是多少人的回忆阿
Terasa damai. Hebat bikin bangku bamboo. Yg suka kasih komentar
The girl in the video just encouraged me to make my own furniture. Wow!!!🥰
Wao impresionante.. esa si es una mujer.  👍
每次看她的视频心都会静下来，不知道是音乐还是什么？
Okay this is the most wholesome channel I've ever seen. This is inspiring!
Whats with all the people thinking this is fake?, is her cooking all CGI or something as well?

Chinese or not this is just bush craft, people do this all over the world (just different materials)

Like anyone she was taught to do this by elders no doubt 🤷‍♂️
You are multi talented. . Love from INDIA. .💖
this is must be the heaven
女漢子！以前好像看過你的視頻也是用竹子做家具。沒想到今年被央視頒了獎才知道你YouTube也有頻道。不錯不錯！
I was about to type she needs to make pillows and then she started making pillows
there is a team behind her, anyway,  bamboo furniture  is true.  any rural chinese in southern china  has the memory to sleep on  these works
Furniture with full of bamboo not any other material neither metal nails nor any thing to paste each other
awe-inspiring, you are more capable than a lot of men!
还有什么你不会的😊
My dad saw this and was so excited.
He was born in Hunan China in 1932, a province next to where this girl lives.  
He couldn't believe this "little girl" made furniture that he remembers sleeping on during summer to escape the heat when he was a child.
He was impressed that she made it with he same finesse as the "old masters" did when he saw them do the work.
He left home before he turned into an adult to fight the communist and lived most of his life in Taiwan as an R.O.C. veteran/Teacher, and he hasn't seen furniture like this, made in such a way, since he left his childhood home

So... this is legit!!!

Hello i am from indonesia i like you :)
有钱能使鬼推磨
respectful and grateful greetings from Argentina
Not only being a talented chef, carpenter, artist and so on,  Ziqi also demonstrated her bravery of conquering any difficulty with her bare hands, and in a skillful and graceful way. For kids living in cities nowadays, Ziqi is a precious role model for them.
Omg I love it.
This work is just so amazing to me. Your rural life is my dream 小七. 希望有一天能来拜访的地方
Nature ♥️✌️
劳动之美
this inspired me to do my home work and apply for jobs (i have social anxiety and have quit jobs due to anxiety). this makes me feel like i do nothing all day, i should be making furniture for my grandparents
我家以前也有竹凉席，夏天总是要在室外睡到半夜。过去不觉得到，现在感觉是多么美好

See. It does exist. Femininity, physicality, and master craftsmanship. True beauty.
You know? You are in the Paradies.
Respect & love .
고마운 유튜브 알고리즘이 날 여길로 인도했다..
Que talento,  que lugar de paz, parabéns pelo trabalho perfeito com a natureza
All her movements are very quick and energetic, but incredibly precise. Amazing to watch a master at work.
People all over the world watch this girl.💚
Thumbs up times 1000 :)
谁在帮她抬竹子？应该有字幕啊！
打了MOD的真人版MC高端玩家
4:12 it's so satisfying how she measured the gap so accurately that when it folds around the bamboo it stands at 90°. What an intelligent woman
So glad to see her videos! She is using her way to keep our culture going on.
เธอสวยงามมากเก่งด้วย😗
不明白黑她的人是什麼心態，這種俐落程度怎麼可能是演出來的？？
Man, working with bamboo must be tough!
You can hear the bamboo bump together and it sounds like thick plastic.


What can't Li ziqi do? 2:40
She’s so breathtakingly beautiful, one half of my family comes from her province. The south all along the Yangtze is so beautiful too, having grown up in the northwest corner near the border of Kazakhstan, I really wish I grew up here instead.
哇哦，厉害
平和やなぁ、素敵です
看到她好享受自己的生活
太神奇了
As a woodworker myself, its interesting to see the way the same tecniques are utilized on such a different material to achieve a very flattering result. In particular, i liked the heat bending for the bamboo table.

It's all very simple, nothing particularly difficult. But these simple tecniques and materials are used to achieve a great result.
Away from the workplace, away from villains
he who has this girl，then has the world. lol
Mui bien saldos desde cancun mexico
宁静祥和
She is so beautiful ,and the way she works is even more beautiful😍
A gorgeous woman who makes beautiful furniture.
So many people want to live in her way, as they only see the beautiful side through the screen. When you see the clear and clean water, she feels the frozen coldness. When you see the green vegie garden, she smells the  manure. When you marvel at a new furniture or building, she suffers the stabbing and cutting from sharp bamboo pieces. Look at her hand, how much hard work she has to do behind the camera? How many of you realized that there is no heating in room in her area where the winter temp is below zero? Yes, it is mostly like a  traditional south China rural life style. However, you have to know, such people in the third world saved all natural resources to be "wasted" in the first world. When you think what she is doing is a fun, many people living in her way is struggling and their whole year income is under $2000.
職人ですよね🎋
beautiful Girl I love, Good work.
It is impressive! No workbench, no complex machinery, literally: "handmade"
What kind of creature could "not like" this?
我不相信一个瘦小的女人能做这些！！
美女有点女汉子的味道，是我喜欢的类型，必须点赞
God Bless You and Your Family. That is How Life Should Be Lived🌹❤🌞
잘! 만드네요~ 예쁘기도 하고, 화이팅~~~
My brain: ill go early to sleep tonight

현대의 스트레스가 이렇게 심한 사회에서도 이런 영상만이 우리를 조금이나마 완화시켜주고, 틈만 나면 꼭 깊은 산속의 숲으로 들어가 어린 시절의 생활을 경험해보도록 하세요
太厲害了，怎麼這麼有才華!!👍👍👍
Amazingly beautiful place and really pretty girl doing incerdible stuff. Feels like another world.
以后就应该这样，展现东方女性的力量感
Muito bom!
Parabéns!
How come she is so perfect at everything?
Very nice. I get the strange feeling she's also good at Kung-Fu.
Words cannot express how happy I was to find this beautiful channel. My mother died last week totally unexpectedly and watching your videos is cleansing my soul. Thank you from the bottom of my heart x
Yes.  I need her as my girl.
Wow that's amazing!!

I love your life, I wish I could live with you.. I’m from Saudi Arabia
I want to come learn from this woman
学机械的已经傻了
كومه من الابداع 😢😂😂😂
She doesn’t have time to gossip, to complain, to sue people, watch tv, compare herself to others, to envy or have jealousy, looking at social media, she is just the best role model for women everywhere.  I love the way she loves her grandma.
卧槽这么牛的吗
Ur so talented... 👌

かっこいい
She is making furniture the traditional way. I am glad I had a chance to watch her video, it's a fast food age and people forgotten the true beauty our ancestors left behind

Bamboo is very strong yet looks easy to cut and carve. Now I want all my furniture to be from bamboo. I thought my DIY were nice. Hers is amazing.
와

I'm new to her channel it's 10:39 Thursday November 21st. I'm here from a recommendation in the comment section of another video.
Muito inteligentíssima. Parabéns aos chineses

I watched all your videos on Weibo and they are very beautiful. Life is like this, this kind of world, this kind of life, this kind of you, this kind of realm, is what we long for. Watching your video is a treat
I am impressed 😮
What!? The beautiful china girl made this bamboo sofa ? I knew china has many bamboo.

After watching several of her videos, I am very much convinced that there is nothing this woman can't do

So she makes an entire living room set for her home. Meanwhile, I can't be bothered to throw the single load of wash I did today into the dryer..
I loved ur art...
진정 대단한 여인내다  따봉
神仙姐姐，全能
Like si no entiendes los comentarios
Watching this makes me think: What am I doing with my life?
Phụ nữ luôn mạnh mẽ và quyết đoán trong công việc...
看哭了
It's Amazing 
It's teaches us consistent hard work, Eco-love and natural living.
为何你们那边的竹树可以随便砍
Beautiful!

i would rest for probably a year or so, after carrying that much weight on my shoulder all the way through the woods.
I ADORE HER SO MUCH GOOD GOD

I am ashamed of myself that I have no such skills 😭
어우 사운드 징짜 힐링이다

I think we just found the perfect match for Primitive Technologies guy
Outstanding.
Beautiful and great Chinese girl.
There must be a woman before a man.🤔
Lovely video, interesting.
If there's ever a zombie apocalypse I know where I would go. 

Great content BTW 👍🏻
My question is there anything you can't do? :)
寧可食無肉，不可居無竹
厉害厉害，3千万的浏览量，这妹纸真是个人物啊！啥都能干！有个问题，还有专人拿相机么？一些特写肯定是有专人拍的。
Please tell me where to buy pants
i cant properly put together an ikea furniture with a manual 
this woman is a goddess
Bamboo sirf china main hi nahi 
Bharat
Japan
Korea 
Main bhi paya jata ha 
Aur hamra india main iski bhoot jatiya ha 
Sara credit china ko hi kyu milta ha
If i would have done that with my bare hands I would have had 100 cuts on my skin. Bamboos have very sharp edges when they are split into small pieces...!
Her granny must be so proud of her 🥺
What is Ikea DIY?
I love the little haha when she stood on the homemade couch.
This is amazing,  I can't even make a grilled cheese sandwich
have a loved ones
Your vedios are relaxing and entertaining. You are a very skilled person!
لي مغربي حط جيم ههههه
A beautiful woman making furniture with the bare basics!!inspiring!!
She’s so gorgeous, yet super skilled! She made me question my life. I’m a nerd - 24/7 behind a computer, so this is a new world to me 
haha
I love craft work thank you for marking my comment good morning here is from Brazil friend.
Why the bamboo here are awesome while Philippines are all struggle to each other hahhaa sana all
Real-life Princess, my goodness.
哈哈
She's just like those fragile looking but insanely strong anime characters.
真爱了
"I want that"
場所がエモすぎる
小时候夏天就用这种床，搬到外面度过一个炎热的夏天，但算不上沙发吧，只能说是竹床。
No glue. No nails or screws.

Still, she seems to achieve perfection.

This is probably the most beautiful thing I'm going to see today!!
O_O
这丫头在真正的体现中国人的聪明才智，大家要珍惜，请不要与任何的政治挂钩，那样就会变了味道！

Pasti bapaknya nih yg ngajarin dan lihat sejak kecil
Pakdhe, suk nek do gawe lincak divideo trus dilebokne yutub, sopo reti akeh sing nonton.

Parabéns ficou ótimo
these videos are honestly the solution to my stress
Con gái giỏi thât! Con thật TUYỆT VỜi! Chúc mừng con nhé!
молодчина смотрю на неё и глаз радуе не то что некоторые
幾乎不需要旁述。鏡頭的運用和鋪排乾脆利落，使視頻有條不序的展開。每一個關鍵的步驟只需要一到兩秒的鏡頭來闡述。所需要的工具，工藝，手法，無一遺漏地一秒呈現。加上緩慢優美的音樂，會使觀眾得到兩種效果的感受。第一，你很享受這個視頻的悠閒和成就。第二，如果你身邊也像子柒一樣萬事俱備，你也同樣可以做出有模有樣的東西。有一種代入的成功感。
You are amazing!
We all have to agree that this is the best Chanel on YouTube... I'm mean...
Beautiful my lady
Mujer más hermosa y creativa saludos desde Venezuela
第一次看这个 这简直就是神仙 并不是做这些有多难 而是做这个要花费太多时间了 小时候看见外公外婆做过 现在都是直接买的 方便很多 看到制作过程 莫名很亲切
Like ,thank you !
How many skills she has? 
She can be a cook, Taylor and she can make a furniture. 
Plus she seems never get tired and physically strong 😅
She knows how to do it all.
看着你的视屏我也只能感叹:你就是无所不能本人了

😭😭😭😭
I became your fan .truelly you  inspired
Oh my god, plz marry me..
I'm stunned that she casually went out, grabbed some bamboo from the forest and then made this 😲🤯
OMG What a gifted woman. How does a video like this get a "thumbs down"  ?? I don't understand .. but this is so FANTASTIC! I LOVE IT!
鲁班  后人吗
天府之国吗

I cant even follow an IKEA instructions manual. Hella props to her omg.
Love you 😍
What an amazing woman, that she is..
Is this a clip from a movie or a crafting video?
Saya dari Indonesia saya salut sampe keluar air mata
Sexist: woodwork is a man's job
This woman: *observe*

Edit: 
Sry i thought bamboo some sort of wood because of how strong it is, also thankies for the likes :>
中国制造
找个中文评论太难了😂
人称，女汉子
I admire her work. I can guarantee that she ends up with many cuts to her hands and fingers, it impossible not to cut herself working with bamboo bare handed.
I saw an interview with her where she mentioned that her grandfather made furniture and taught her all about it when she was younger. It's wonderful to see that she keeps the tradition.
Now this is a strong and independent woman. Murican girls think they are but needs a man all the time...
厉害哟
เก่งมากๆเลย
Chinese soft power, I guess?
Not only she is pretty but the stuff she makes are pretty aswell ♥
Hatsoff to this lady 🌟
I Love You I Love China  From Thailand

I wanna a girl hard work as  her
Seeing how to bend bamboo 90 degrees makes me smile.
自愧不如
Girl ! You are awsome !
这个女孩太厉害了
Parabéns... Você é uma grande artista...
Head Architect: Alright you’ll be designing half the building, inside and out. What tools do you need?

와우🤗🤗🤗🌷🌷🌷
Wonge g adus wae....tetep putih lan ayu.....jozzz....👍👍👍👍
Watching this video I saw elegance in her movement as she cut through, bent, and shaped the bamboo is so many ways...but with her elegance there was a sense of strength and hard work put into the making of the furniture. Watching this calmed me and I felt a sense of relax. I love this video, and I love how you made it with only bamboo and other utensils.☺️😊
입을 다물수가 없다.
i love that girl
Liziqi write some thing in kosom what is that?
It might only take her 30 secs to assemble a set of IKEA shelves.
When your waifu power is at max level

ไม้ไผ่สวยมาก
It's a interesting lifestyle she has. She makes stuff from the things she finds, a very Eco friendly way of living. I wouldn't pull it off. Respect.
Isn't Bamboo the best natural materials
Rajin amat.mbak.dr indonesia.

Do you sell to the public?
Just assuming we have all been gathered together randomly by YouTube’s random algorithm 
Let’s take a second to praise the lord above 🙏
It's very nice and you are highly talented
Awsome job xx
Wow!
没去过中国的歪果仁会不会认为中国人的生活就是这样的呢？毕竟很多人看了张艺谋的电影后以为中国人过的就是电影里的生活，不知冰箱和电视为何物的，😓。十年前在英国留学就被问过有没有见过电视，而那时英国还落后的很多地方卖黑白小电视呢，但是在中国都早就绝迹了。竟然还问我有没有见过电视，真是惊掉下巴。
I really don’t understand why people would dislike this ??
Ikea want to know your location
Please marry meee !!

想起小时候做雪橇，那下面的两条滑行板就是用竹子在火上烤到快要烧起来的时候折弯后做成的。不过，城市里没有那么多竹子，往往都是自家的破竹床上劈下来的。只是现在极少下雪了，或许是气候变暧之故吧！
I wish I lived in a place like that. Im tired of the smog, stupid ppl and drivers, and concrete jungles of Los Angeles.....😪

善良，坚毅，大方，幽默，好客，艰苦奋斗，奋发图强。这些都是中华民族的优秀品质。哪怕随着历史长河浩浩荡荡飘远无际，人们的生活品质日新月异，古老的一些传统可能已经失去传承的土壤，我们也能因为某些血脉中的东西，而骄傲地称我们是炎黄子孙。
谢谢你，李子柒。你让我看到了传统的中国人在现代生活中的样子。哪怕我因为我的自身条件不能拥有这样的生活，我也不会丢掉中华民族的品质。

I don't know why I watch stuff like this, I guess because its peaceful to me, and it brings peace to mind.  The music, her  Surroundings. The flowers, and the work she put into The furniture. 😊 is  Relaxing

I am a Hawaiian born Japanese woman who practices traditional Chinese medicine and you have once again made me fall in love with Chinese culture!  

I didn’t know mugwort could be used as a filler for cushions!  I wonder how it must smell.  I also loved the technique you used to bend bamboo.  It looks beautiful in its green state, but I’m guessing it will age into a nice beige color.  

It totally looked as if you had done this before.  Your tools were so specific and your movements were so deliberate and efficient!
Speech less
What a wonder lady
super!👍❤💋🍾🍷
Wow very beautiful creation
I love how this channel brings people together from so many different cultures and languages! Liziqi is my inspiration. I live in Vietnamese

if you have a bambu forest,who needs IKEA? 🤦‍♂️
Не перестает удивлять эта чудо-девушка!
Don’t know why his got recommended to me but I’m glad it did. Video is filmed beautifully and I think I’ve fallen in love with the lady in the video.
i wish bamboo grew this big in the UK. Mine's puny.
我是一位土耳其姑娘、以前在中国留学过、后来回国开始工作了。工作跟中国或中文没有任何关系、但没办法嘛。梦里有中国、一边想念想它、一边继续在土耳其活着。很想很想中国的时候，就看您的视频。您的视频让我回到我的第二家。感谢您给我们看这种很有特色的生活方式。感谢您的一颗努力的好心。
Every move she makes is dripping in confidence
At first I was jealous because of all the cool things she can do and build and all the knowledge she must possess but I realize it’s her confidence and sureness I wish I had
She’s amazing
Beautiful girl
Far out. You make amazing furniture from bamboo and I have issues putting together a coffee table from Ikea -.-
I need a woman like that she is very very special
Now I have no doubt that the Great Wall of China was built ...  by Chinese women!
竟然翻墙来看你
I love that she doesn't talk and try to explain everything. The silence adds to the power of these videos. Everyone around the world can just watch, learn and enjoy from this brilliant woman Li ZiQi.
I really need this woman
RESPECT ✊🏻🖤 

Also I think it’s literally the first time in ages YouTube recommended something Actually good to me.
Primitive skills and eco friendly techniques. 👍🏼
She make everything look so easy
I wanna live that kind of life
*感叹我们这个伟大民族，之所以能生生不息传承几千年，正是有着勤劳智慧的劳动人民，传承着农耕文化。改革开放三十年，社会快速的发展，让城市和农村都失去了很多风貌，遗失了很多技能传承，这个代价付出的很无奈……很庆幸子柒眼光独到，深耕传统文化，用视频讲述中国故事，让世界爱上中国，真的超欣慰！大爱子染！💋*
My god, her hair is so beautiful. She's so talented!!!
Hay phết
With this lighting, music, and production quality you could’ve made a mid-budget K-drama but you had to pull a 180 on us and make a fricking sofa out of scratch. 10/10 excellent video.
Watching her video, I want to cry because people in the world can understand such a culture. They all yearn for the life described in ancient Chinese poetry.
احبها هايه البنية
Steady soul
I don't know how to say it in chinese.. but what you make, the way you make all the things are awsome .. you are an amazing person 💕 thanks for sharing all this peace and beauity with the world
Wooooow
Sus has super strength to lift up all that bamboo
沙发都上来了，我看你还能编多久！
Why are you so handy?
Don't you love when YouTube recommendation is actually working?
怎么感觉李子柒是全能王者，太强了
You are gifted and very beautiful.  Very nice very lovely

👍👍👍👍👍🌹❤❤❤❤❤
For those who question her, Ziqi was abandoned by her parents when she was born. She was adopted by a women but was not well treated. Her grandparents finally took care of her however they are old. Ziqi grew up alone and left home when she was 14. She did many jobs to survive and learned so many things (she was even a DJ at some time). Life is tough for her but she never gave up. However her grandmother was seriously sick so she decided to go back home and took care of her. Luckily, her record of her life made her famous and gave her a better life. What a tough girl!
everytime she uploads im just glad i get to see that Grandma is well
She goes to the garden and finds every single ingredient she wants i went to the market forgot what i came for
This channel beats anything they're showing on Food Network in the states.
广西柳州的螺蛳粉，做起来和吃起来一样的享受
While I don't think I could live this type of lifestyle, I am very grateful to have this channel to watch, learn from, and enjoy!
I’m so shook and deeply confused about the incredible production quality
it is  amazingly beautiful , so nature.
虽然做法工序跟我们传统的螺蛳粉有所不同，但谢谢你把它变得如此诗意，更谢谢你用了正确的发音！每次听到别人说luo shi fen 我都觉得有责任科普一下 那字读si
I think is  one of most happy ladies. I  like this lifestyle .
看了子柒的视频，我更加迷惑，什么样的生活才是我想要的？
I always forget she lives in the modern world with us. So lovely😍
这家伙怎么这么火 老外是不是一脸懵逼
才知道螺蛳粉原来和螺有关的是汤底！最近好迷螺蛳粉！！！！大半夜看饿了~~~~~要去买子柒出的螺蛳粉！！！
有时间一定要去趟柳州吃一次😄
过的简直是千年来中国古人的生活,当代陶渊明吗
我馋哭了😭
一看手 和举手投足就不是干活的人,营销包装出来的视频而已,回家看看各位爸爸妈妈的手,就知道了,难怪被爆料出来是个混夜店的主儿
李子柒这种农村生活是理想的回不去的，虽然我也是农村的
这种youtuber谁还能推荐几个
别人的视频是教你如何制作美食，而这视频，简直是艺术品！太赞了！
向往的生活
取之自然 用之自然 在當今社會真的看不到如此的美麗景色
螺蛳粉旁的那碟菜，是五行菜吧?
Amazing they should eat like that!
What a relaxing and peaceful music ..feel like a healings...👌👌😮
豪华至尊版螺蛳粉，太棒了
手脚麻利，是干过农活的人，不像城市养尊处优的小姐。就是打扮和手脚太干净了！：-）
this just made me realize how lazy i am, can't even cook a simple meal
Longing for such a rural life
螺蛳粉的味道外乡人大概都闻不惯吧，不过吃倒是蛮好的
四川的山上确实有很多东西，我的老家院子也很大，中了很多东西，就是没她那么多，不过也挺真实
Li Ziqi is amazing! I enjoy watching her videos. By the way, am I the only one who noticed the little dog in the video ? It’s so cute. 💞
I love how she is just the human version of Minecraft
神仙小姐姐，虽然重头戏是螺蛳粉，但筹备过程中满足了两天的菜谱，棒棒的
太好了，有这么厉害的视频拉动农村的形象，不用去管农村了
老姐呀 你那物质太丰富了🤣
This is what I imagine an ancient Chinese daughter in law would do all day...
Everything she has is reusable or can be given back to the earth. I love this channel. It's everything we can only dream for the world to be.
It's 2:50 am in Chinese time and after watching this video I take out my phone and order takeout.I think I'm hungry.
纯天然，
原汁原味的美食
螺蛳粉真的好吃呀(｢･ω･)｢
李子柒确实是个才女，什么都会，谁娶了谁有福
More than 500K views in 4 hours .... Wow! Her following is very huge, but understandable coz her video indeed are very good. Keep it up... Liziqi.
А там у вас бывает снег когда-нибудь?
watching this makes me feel home😍💕
這要能當太太真好
just thinking in what a should kook tomorrow. ....is killing me slowly 
i don't know how she do that
We Northeast Indians can relate to your content on another level. The simple yet sustainable lifestyle is the way to go. Lots of love to you. 💓
大晚上看饿了！！！！！饿了？？？？？！？！？！
唉呀妈呀 口水都出来了 感觉应该很好吃
论美食NO.1必须是 China
你太棒了 谢谢你的视频！
I never know when she picks something if she's going to eat it or make something out of it!
老外怕是吃不来螺蛳粉哦
好样的李子柒！我也是四川人，真心为你感到骄傲。
2:56 look like a Vermeer scene...
螺蛳粉真的有螺在里面哦。
If there ever is a Zombie Apocalypse, I want to be with Liziqi.
4:54 don't let quentin tarantino watch this
I am chinese I like live in 农村
It's already eaten. It's really delicious
就像是单反镜头下的世界，真实而又陌生。。。。。
I accidently pressed this video 
And.....



IT WAS MY BEST MISTAKE EVERRR 


Edit:jezzz 300+ likes?!
By the way I'm new here🙂😊
This girl makes me think how lazy I am 😣😣😔😔😖😖🙁🙁😒😒😒
Really perfect wife ❤️😍
I really enjoy watching her. She is so skilled and the video has a peaceful quality about it.
Just do it, this is a true Nike spirit!
Me: Liziqi, do you know how to-
Liziqi: y e s
I wish I could live in places that can grow this type of bamboos
I'm in love the way she lives!
有一种国风武侠游戏里，一个生活在山里的农家小舍的美丽Npc的直视感
最开始在微博看李子柒的动态和视频，后来在抖音，人在国外，天天用YouTube，居然是在央视评论中知道李子柒在YouTube也这么受欢迎，作为中国人骄傲，说明外国人也越来越接受我们的美食和文化了
This woman is my hero, she can do anything!
I like your video when i watch your video i feel is very relax 
Thanh you
Missing my grandma😢🙏...How could life not being peaceful, relaxing and pleasant with grandma beside?
螺蛳粉我真的好爱
這個粉太辣了吧，受不了😄。石螺炒好吃。
Bamboo shoot is also one of the most popular vegetables in Northeast India. We farment or dry it and cook it with pork.
大半夜的 给我看饿了
Amazing lovely indostrious beautiful angelic woman...liziqi.
Gutui chu sathu me din duchat a um na ae...let's confused them😂🤣🤣 ...Thadou Ana VA kha sisin like uvo

好久没吃过螺丝粉了，流口水中。。。
原来国内说的2000w是真的..，I like she‘s videos very much~
Her garden contains everthing in the worldヾ(●´∇｀●)ﾉ～
美！人杰地灵，天府之国！
This is the only channel that I eagerly look forward to watching. So much hard work done by her and her crew,  thanks.
闻到酸笋那个味儿，哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈😂
我最喜欢吃这种竹笋
中国文化，博大精深，特别是在吃的方面几千年来，从未停过钻研
说来好笑，人民日报给子柒站台，国内一群人阴阳人阴阳怪气的，反而在YouTube。。。。。。
When heaven showered beauty and talents, she caught them all!
saya orang indonesia yg suka lihat you tube ini 😚😚😚🇮🇩
这也太好吃了😭
Antarctica travel vlog
👈⛴️🌍🛩️
子柒的奶奶，肯定也交给了他很多生活技能。
Wow, 8 hours later she got more than a million views... thanks for the English sub,,,
还是猪肉炖粉条，酸菜土豆好吃。
唉！想吃螺蛳粉了😳
I bet that bamboo shoot must be very tasty.
好吃的竹筍要在日照充足烈陽底下採收，並立即烹飪
每一種植物都有它特定的採收時段
Ai thích ăn Măng không? Nhất là măng chua 😶😶
看懂了视频却看不懂评论ε=(´ο｀*)))唉
太厉害了，我口水流一地😋😋😋😋😋
姑娘 你真美 你拍视频是在什么地方啊
Liziqi: makes really good home made food by getting it from plants and lakes she finds 

Me: eats McDonald’s while watching liziqi
光你这刀工堪比一级厨师的刀工啊！！！
Phụ đề sai bét tè lè nhè... người ta nói một đằng.. dịch một nẻo...
婆婆，你看，这个笋子比我脑壳还大，哈哈哈
I am Chinese, I like her video although i know that  Chinese of most  dont life as her video.
Ziqi is the most talented and hardworking girl.
Anyone agree with me
我也是广西人虽然几十年来在广西都没有呆足一个月，这种淳朴温馨的生活真是令人心神向往，祈求你们永远幸福，香菇
This is so amazing to watch . I wish I could live like this, I'm sure its very hard but being one with nature and being able to supply for your family from what your landscape offers is such a magical thing. I'm jealous of how you live, you are beautiful and smart and doing amazing things for the environment. Thanks for letting us watch your beautiful life. Its so peaceful
这是找的演员么？看的化妆很浓
令人羨慕的田園生活
You can literally eat everything if you put that chilli sauce on top 😂😂
She is a charm in herself man .
It feels so good to see her cook .
아 한국인이라 식재료 식습관 좀 비슷해서 무슨 맛인지 알것같아 더 미치겠다...ㅜㅜㅠ
넘나 맛있어보여...ㅜㅜㅠㅠㅠ
姐姐 我能来你家吃饭吗 就吃一勺
终于轮到中国文化输出了，让别人知道中国人的审美情趣。这完全符合中国古典田园文化
Can't believe early to watch her video 😍💜 I love u Lizi!
.
.
Omg this is my 1st time comment since I've been watching all of her videos, tq for 'ur thumbs up guys! I know this is cuz of Ziqi's lovers! 💜💜
谁能把你娶回家 那真的很幸福
This is not the China that cnn, bbc, falungong extremists in Hongkong and Taiwan etc, talking about
虽然都是演的，但好歹也是中国传统文化
俺寻思这要吃顿饭半天啥也别干了，属实有点复杂嗷！
No matter how many millions of money we have in our bank accounts..If there is no peace of mind,healthy body and calm life..Nothing can replace these
其实中国有很多美食，然而我们宣传的不是很充分，舌尖上的美食纪录片不够哇
Mom, I am in love～
好吃，太好吃了。但螺絲粉不是發源于鄉村，而是不知不覺的出現于柳州街邊攤點。
很美、素晴らしい。
I love the sounds of running water, chopping, snapping of beans. Scrubbing of shells, sizzling, steaming!!!
這女生由早忙到晚, 很辛苦。。。。
Ước j có được cô vợ như jậy
歸去來兮，田園將蕪胡不歸
每一帧都可以当桌面。
Me: eating unhealthy and watching healthy💜💜💜
最近才了解到李子染，刚刚看了几个视频哇塞实在太棒了，活出了许多人想要的样子，也没有生活负担，挺你！
so clean n beautiful .. 😍😍 #love from northeast india♥️
这个笋看着好沉的感觉
Mantap, sangat indah desamu.
The goddess of China is back to soothe the minds of us mere mortals for a few moments 🙌🏽
影片色调调的好有很大功劳，真实色彩下这种农活我是一点不想去干的：想想蝉鸣下的阳光有多毒，地里的蚊虫有多多，鸡鸣鹅叫的院子会不会有动物的屎尿味儿，土炕烧锅刷锅多麻烦，算了还是窝在家里吹空调舒服。但是视频展现的意境很美好，向往之。
She does what I did when I was younger back in home country. Man! What a childhood. So much memories.. 😩 and thank you for showing the value of life.
So satisfying to watch this
記得小時候我家豬舍邊的木頭就真的長出黑木耳!
宝贝，干活时最好带个手套吧，不要让手太辛苦了。
两千多万观看我的天😳
只有一个想法，娶回家
اللهم يسر لي فهادا التعليق يييييااااااارب
현실에서 할 수 없지만 저렇게 살고파~
开个饭店就叫李子柒 每天就两桌 姑娘没一年你就是百万富翁
螺蛳粉我的爱
姐姐好棒呀！
This lady lives like a IRL Studio Ghibli movie, I love it ❤️
這牌子的螺螄粉是比較好吃😁，雖然有點貴🤗
我也想尝试做这些菜
600w粉丝我的天
Очень красивая девочка!)

just so u know, this is su ti mo’s favorite noodles haha
这螺蛳粉做的太牛逼了
If I believed in reincarnation I would want to come back as that girls Grandma.
I always wonder... *Grandma is so so so so so lucky to have such an amazing grandchild.*
-No one:
-Not a soul:
-Liziqi: Aye, let me flex my skills on y'all 4 times in one week.






(it's a joke. I admire her. dont kill me. lmao)
看到她 就好像看到我的童年
柳州人看了感觉没什么食欲。用料不对
Es demasiado placentero!
油管的一股清流
看饿了我也
My mom would cook authentic phillipino food every single day without stop, after she lost her battle with cancer about a year ago ive never had the same feeling of just coming home from school to smell the most amazing food ive ever tasted. Your videos brings back these memories, the frying of the food sounds the same in your videos, her tossing the food in the wok, the scrapeing of the metal on the pan, i can even SMELL whats going on through the screen. Your videos saved me from ever forgetting her, your videos helped me out through those dark times, though its not phillipino food, the way you cook is so so so similar to my mom’s. Thank you for that. (Ive also shown these videos to my dad and he also loves them, my entire family is full of cooks so this was a breath of fresh air)
李子柒我求求你住手吧！！！！我受不了了！！！！！暴风哭泣！！！！！！！
شقد حياتها جميلة ولطيفة عالرغم من التعب 😍
真的是很喜歡她的美食製作視頻，小姐姐太棒了
饿了色 洒满色热水 壶 户满哦色次摸 牛啊☺
She's the queen of being industrious. Such a resourceful woman
I used to eat this in Philippines 💗
envy her life.
Brave lady God bless my mother ahe always remembered how they was living in there land grand grand mother.they done all .the turkish came took all
Wonderful natural live! Protect our earth 🙏
No one

Subtitle English :
"Careful when replicating this at home. We don't want fermented finger tips and nails"
This is such a relaxing channel
这道菜做的繁复啊
One of my favorite food 螺蛳粉
有明显的纰漏，凉水开始煮粉丝明显不对，柴火炉灶本来烧水就不会太快，等水烧开了粉丝可能都已经烧糊了，一般都需要开水下粉丝。
While we spend hundreds of dollar try to buy what so called "organic food" Liziqi just pick her ingredients in the backyard.  It's awesome.
酸笋，晕了！
哈哈哈第一次在油管上看到
I am TAMILNADU.நான் தமிழ்நாடு.I like nature.எனக்கு இயற்கை பிடிக்கும்.This is awesome.என்ன அற்புதம்?
看得我想立马去点一碗粉来吃
Nothing better than to wake up on a Sunday morning here in England & see Li Ziqi..;-))
陶渊明笔下世外桃源，美！
:O!! Those bamboo shoots are BIG! I thought they were usually like... hand-sized!
充满仙气的宝藏女孩
愿做你身边的小花狗
It's bamboo. There are many pandas not too far from where she lives. I'm sure pandas love to try her bamboo dish too.
来自国人的问候
这媳妇勤快有会做菜！！！
编辑的不错，加油
哇 竹笋哎  大木耳 好想吃一口
I discovered her at 2am and I literally think there is no better channel. Her videos are soothing and educating and Honest content.
Mình mê những video của bạn rồi. Bạn vừa giỏi và xinh đẹp. Chúc bạn luôn hạnh phúc bên bà và thành công trong cuộc sống.
大晚上的，看得口水直流😂
关注你很多年了，一开始是在微博看你的视频，现在微博和YouTube一起看，每个视频都会看两遍以上。还记得有一期视频你说，暂时不会拍了，因为很多质疑你的声音，让你觉得很难过，还有人去人肉你的家。感谢你坚持了下来！YouTube上面关注你的人越来越多，很为你感到高兴！加油💪
Enjoy watching this on a big TV. Really like the country style simple cooking with fresh ingredients of morning dew bamboo shoots, wood ears, long string beans, ... NICE!
Watching your videos calm my soul. You always show me that nature provides and it's up to us on how we can use it efficiently. 💖🍅
100% wife material !!
这才是一个频道该有的样子，怒赞。
田园美食生活，是奢侈
I would love to take a trip to China. Be in a place like this for a week to experience the culture
honestly i’m glad i got an ad, she deserves to be monetized
特地来收藏点赞，姑娘加油，走自己的路，不用理睬路边狂吠的野狗。
I like a good wife like that. Fantastic, wonderful...
What a beautiful place to live. This is what life is about.. taking care of the ones who took care of us, when they no longer can take care of themselves.
绵阳人表示没吃过凉拌马齿苋😂
Có ai Việt Nam không điểm danh nào!!!!
🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳
这腊肉～还是自己养的猪好吃…
田螺小时候吃过无数次
说的还是四川话诶
you are an amazing work of art. As well as your work. and you live in the most beautiful land I have ever seen I live in Hawaii thank you for your videos.
세상에.. 3 videos in a week ?? 
We dont deserve you, liziqi. Thank you so much.
Hutan bambu, banyak genderuwo kalau di indonesia . 
wewe gombel juga ada .  
ada orang indonesia ?
Thanks for the english subtitle. Its been hard watching chinese video without english subtitle for none chinese viewer lol
May I know the music you used for this video? It's really mesmerizing and made my soul wanted to indulge more into the Chinese culture that runs in my blood (that I just knew).
让浮躁的心感到宁静
People: nature paradise don't exis-

Liziqi: hold my rice bowl
3个月，2100多万观看，太他妈牛逼了！
沒有抽油煙機時間久了很傷肺
From Indonesian, please like just now
The sautéed bamboo shoot w. Chinese bacon seems so yummy!🤤
观察了一段时间，发现子柒频道有以下几个特点：
首先是粉丝群又广又厚，做为一个不是自己亲自管理的油管频道，
而且在油管上和粉丝毫无互动，能做到目前这样子的规模很不容易，
毕竟频道最初是从粉丝帮忙搬运起家，多少有点“无心插柳柳成荫”的感觉；
其次是视频点赞率高，比一般频道高出近10倍的点赞率，这点很了不起，
说明视频质量高，不像油管上好多千万订阅的频道都是渣一样的点赞率，
毕竟出了名之后每天发点烂片混日子骗钱的频道油管上太多太多了；
最后就是频道人气高，评论数量自身就说明了一切，
而且我敢保证整个油管上这么和谐的大频道根本就没几家，
子柒这里就是其中一家，俨然一副世界大融合的景象。
看到你就看到了生活的动力，为自己、为家人好好努力感受当下，这样的人生同样可以多姿多彩。加油！
是我心中嚮往的陶淵明式的田園生活阿，這是屬於中國人的傳統浪漫It is the rural life of tao yuanming that I yearn for in my heart, which belongs to the traditional romance of Chinese people
地道螺蛳粉！爽脆！
there is an anime called "Mushishi" , these videos remind me of that. Cozy and chill . Also this is basically Miazaki's attempt at live action.
My father always taught me
Work like a slave
Eat like a monster
And sleep like a king
小妹有男友了没
She is a work hard
I was concerned for Grandma when little missy, cooked eggs with shells still on 😳
吃相太丑了，声音贼大！
nature, colors, fruits, clothes, your grandmother and of course you How everything is so perfect💖👏
田园生活 看这视频很羡慕 真要是去待一个星期 又有多少人会觉得无聊
广西柳州人在此，不吃螺蛳粉白活一世哈哈😄
您做菜的手艺真好 ❤
After watching this video, I am no longer curious about what Michelin 3-star restaurant is.
Hello,I'm from VietNam,my grandfather often watch your videos and he very like it. He said : " You very beautiful and you cook very well" .He wishes he had a peaceful life like you . Love you
The best food channel I ever saw in my entire life.
760万 好吓人阿😰😰😰😰
我靠，为啥我要深夜看这个，好饿啊，看上去都好好吃啊，这味道看上去就超正宗
有这样的媳妇真的是人生幸福之事啊
Hi Granny!!! Who else loves Granny and wants to hug her?
왜 바람의나라가 하고싶어지는걸까...
有机会一定去吃南方的美食
咱要是吃个猪肉韭菜馅儿饺子，是不是得从养猪，种韭菜，种小麦。。。开始？
可怕的观看量
Thank you for your hard work and effort to make us happy, love you♥️🥰
Em đẹp và rất giỏi chúc em thành công
好大的影响力，给你点赞
要么500个摄像机 要么一个很牛逼的专业团队 要么都有 哈哈哈 羡慕这种生活
Income of 50 million yuan, envy
*Warning: Make sure you're full enough before watching this video.*


*Or you'll probably get more hungry.* 😂
柳州螺蛳粉天下一绝。吃苦耐劳，聪慧的仙女。
I don’t know how I found her channel but I’m glad I did!
这个摄像师是 CCTV 的吧？
I want to meet a girl like you😍❤️
She is also one of the best content makers in China.
竹笋我的最爱😋😋
吞口水中....😋
外国粉丝这么多啊？
This video is so beautiful it make me cry 😭
I like how all the utensils she uses are eco friendy as well as her ingredients!
这位就是闹得沸沸扬扬的李子柒了哦！
这么大笋子真少见
Your food looks so good. It looks like you cook enough in a day for my family to eat all week.
好心疼子柒的手。
Imagine the world started to live like this with high buildings inside woods. 😍And no cars just bicycles and Cable cars and all roads s flowers and shops foul of vegetables and fruits and herbs.
OMG, this video got more than 21.5m viewers!
姑娘好美
Let me know why you like her so much. I am curious.
I'm curious about the taste. Thank you for watching the video.
好贤惠的姑娘
Life is beautiful!
看了姐妹的视频之后
想起小时候的一些片段
用材炒菜
还有用那石磨磨豆
自家种菜吃的健康
姐妹好棒
多照顾好自己。💪💙🌻🌻🌻
20191214
在这个时代确实要好好回味一下传统
Today is August 21, 2019 exactly two years since this Channel was established. CONGRATULATIONS LIZIQI, Our dear princess. HAPPY 2ND YEAR ANNIVERSARY, WE WISH YOU MORE YEARS OF SUCCESS AND HAPPINES 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I actually cried5555 I miss Guangxi now
半夜看得我口水直流
這筍一刀劈開就這麼多水分想必好吃極了 。到你家做客好嗎？可惜沒做排骨荀湯，很甘甜的極美味健康美食的 。
Liziqi lives in a wonderland
Hello 
I am from Manipur,a north eastern state of India 
I would like to say that we have similar kind of lifestyle and food habits 
We also eat this kind of food
Love from Manipur,India
Liziqi, I want see your home and garden
当个宣传片看看得了，就是那种吸引旅游的
我小时候也是这样的生活，但是不知道为什么，年龄越大，离这样的生活越远
木水ы人女人 水山 日手山戈 ;-;
李子柒，加油！
the life we wanted, but couldn't get
国外也这么有名
I'm confused about why some people always think that everything from China is related to Communist? Even a video that has no talk?
She gave up the city life and moved back to village to take care of her grandmother 👵  so proud of her! ❤️
얼굴도 예쁘고 손재주도 좋고 요리도 잘하고 팔방미인이시네
好大一支
吃起來會不會比較老...
谢谢子柒cue我们广西螺蛳粉！嘻嘻嘻
This is an amazing female.  Mad props the food always look amazing
This is basically Studio Ghibli in real life... So peaceful, so beautiful, so natural and so holistic, what a life.
想不到还会做我们广西柳州的螺蛳粉，姑娘真是厉害！画面拍得很唯美，间接弘扬了中华文化，必须点赞！
ดีกว่าบ้านชั้นอีกหากืนง่ายจัง
真的太美好了❤
仙女姐姐 不仅隔壁家小孩，我也馋哭了 咋办呢😂哈哈哈哈
嗦个粉配榨菜，又是茶叶蛋的，过分炫富了哦！
Ohh I thought Liziqi made a huge ice cream😂😂😂🍦🍦🍦
看着看着饿了，立马点了外卖螺蛳粉，开吃！😄
It's looking interesting. Moreover the environment, cooking appliances and music making me feel like a Disney World
妹子是哪里人
This is my whole childhood. I am surprised to find out that the lifestyle here in Nepal and China is soo similar although I live in terrains.
隔壁家小孩都馋哭了
สวัสดีครับ อาหารน่ากินมากเลย
妹子，你做饭那么香，我们一起过日子吧，每天就一起吃饭，其他啥也不干。。。
Owning a house growing  veggies to survive and living one among the nature is the only way  one can find happiness.
1:12, “Granny, see? This bamboo shoot is bigger than my head”, ”no biggie, recall our old years.....(我们往年子)”
好療愈的影片！！
아름다운 경치에 아름다운 천사💐
Wow that lifestyle is so beautiful i wish i could live that life surrounded by beautiful nature and beautiful wife away from all the negativity of the world 🙏🏼
一个人撑起了舌尖上的中国
Watching her videos have become my stress reliever from the crowded and busy city. It’s so peaceful and makes me love nature even more! ♥️
Give grandma some soup 😅
这个视频应该有团队来拍摄的吧。
How can relocate and live like this?
Bạn này rất giỏi, làm video nào cũng hay và thú vị
子柒，我觉得把家里房前屋后尤其是灶房的柴火啥的稍微收拾整齐一点更好一些！倒不是摆拍需要，而是农村的生活本来也需要一点点井然有，这样更配你的素然！希望你能看到！！！
So beautiful!😍
小胳膊上的肌肉
i wish life is as simple as this. 😔
Thanks, Dan and Arin.
这也太猛了
Love her video so much!
Nice video just the background 🎶 music makes 😴
我在淘宝买了 确实很不错呢
I thought she was gonna catch that fish with lightning fast hand technique
Someday i want to live a place like that,, so peaceful,, its amazing video!
Dari dulu suka nonton chanel ini😍
Suka cara dia memasak😍 
Wanita tangguh👏🏼
Watch her video like watch a movie! I think she got have a professional/hollywood-level crew supporting her. But the food look great though.
拍摄厉害
Snailed it!
这女的 身价上亿了吧。。。我好酸
铁子们别看了，没有一个女的愿意和你过这种生活，还是努力获得房奴资格，当房奴吧😄
proud of you!
She’s one of the most amazing and talented girl I’ve ever seen on YouTube.. she fed not only her granny but the soul of every viewers.. this is immortality I want to live in that place 😊❤️❤️  i wish more power and strength for u and granny..❤️💪🏻
sungguh sangat menyenangkan menonton vidio youtube dia, memberi ilmu resep resep masakan dan cara mengolahnya...I Like IT...LUAR BIASA
安逸哦！连我这个美国的人都羡慕，不愧为网红！
Waow...this channel is amazing....
制作精良都超过央视了
Granny on a swing looked so happy... made me happy too.
Gotta keep grandma well fed!  She works all day for the good life.
女子很漂亮很能干很勤快 而且感觉做的菜好好吃我都流口水了
好像在哪读到，她说视频是她一个人拍的。一直在看镜头，确实都是静止的。但是这个视频的最后的时候，她和奶奶吃饭，镜头从清晰编程虚化，焦距变了，所以应该是有人在帮着拍，要不就是可以自动变焦的方法
This lady originally had these videos made to promote her online store - which is a good thing. But it reminds me why many ancient Chinese scholars and politicians chose to live in the outside world to get away from politics and reality.
I notice you always do more then one meal for every video, and always keep me enjoying them. No doubt you are absolutely the best. 👍🏻🥰
harvest moon in real life
出囯二十年了看了李子柒的视频才知道世上真的有世外桃源
我想應徵拍攝做家裡等吃的家人XD
First time at her channel. I feel like she’s from the city and moved back home to accompany her grandma. And she might as well start making videos since she has time and can educate people of life in the countryside.  No wonder Netflix came out with “Flavorful Origins” this channel proves there’s a market for those types of shows.
Everytime i watch your video, feels like i'm on the fairytale. The water sound, the animal sound, even the tree when the wind blow it feels so real in my beside
I love you ❤️ Li Ziqi I love 😍 you so much 💕
看她的视频心会静下来
영상은 멋진데, 너무 바쁘다.
เธอเป็นผู้หญิงในฝันของผมเลย เธอเกล่งเธอเก่ง แล้วใช้ชีวิตแบบเรียบง่ายอยู่กับธรรมชาติ นี้แหละครับคือชีวิตในฝันของผมเลย😍😍😍
While I'm laying in this bed... In this boring hospital.. while watching your video suddenly my tears just fall down.. My mom ask me why I'm crying I just answered " Mom, can we visit her before I die" my mom came and hug me while crying...... " Sure baby but promise me you need to be strong, ok" 
" Sure mom"... 
Thank you for making this movie. I really love it❤️❤️❤️ i wish someday soon I will going to be in a place like that 💔
Amazing plastic free life！
The type of wife any man can dream of 😂😂
I really wanna eat some it looks so dang gooddd
Your way of life looks very peaceful, and your food looks  好吃。
Accidentally click the video too,after that could not get enough of it!!...Much more better than watching the Kardashian/Jenner all the time.I'm just so sick of watching the superficial world,where every girls on IG tries to have lips injection and buttock implants.This is the real world,where you could see the beauty of nature,calm,peace of mind and happiness!
谁娶她 谁这辈子有口福了
Lý Tử Thất là em gái Lý Tử Lanh thì phải 😆
Dream house village 😢😢😢
我们四川的妹儿！棒！
Who else would like to have Liziqi’s life ?
老太太晚年是安逸的
I’m watching every ep. of your video.. Amazing 💕💕
这个小姐姐这么火的吗？
انا بعشق هي البنت lLove you ❤️❤️
I find myself watching this channel every Sunday afternoon...so relaxing
我怎么觉得那么像日本电影 小森林 呢？
大外宣传制作吗？
#這不就是陶淵明說的桃花源嘛！😐😐😐
I love bamboo, it's my favourite.
Just make a video of how u maintain ur beautiful garden pls
看的口水直流
比我脑壳还大
没想到啊你在国外也这么火
سلام الله عليك ...💚🍀🌷🌹👑🌹🌷🍀💚
I love the way she made this video - no talking, but let the sounds fulfill screen
这是螺蛳粉？我在柳州没见过螺蛳粉长这样子的啊
叼鹏我也很喜欢吃螺蛳粉呢！
11K dislikes... I am genuinely curious as to why? I mean... I guess it's not exactly a tutorial? lol
我家子柒就是优秀
Honestly that big wok looks like a dream to cook with
这种生活得到很多人的赞同，也是很多人的向往，城市的生活只是让人们变成了金钱的奴隶，当今的社会每个人都在用自己生命时间换金钱……
咋个愣个像四川口音喃
ชอบมากเลย อยากไปนั่งกินด้วย😊
果然很多老外看，虽然说她的视频有失真实，但是不可否认拍的很好
The subtitles 😂😂😂👏 when she's chopping everything super fast, "Be careful when replicating this at home. We dont want  fermented finger tips and nails"
와 영상미 ㄷㄷ
质量好高哇。
Meu sonho é te conhecer pessoalmente e provar essas saborosas receitas...parabéns
what time you will do the video of the "Laoyoufen" ? I really expected,thank you so much,love you~❤
1:20 she said to her gradma：this bamboo is bigger than my head😂😂😂
I cannot imagine how much she needs to do to have such a big garden. She must hire many workers to do the gardening. I only have a few trees, some flowers, and lawn in my garden, I have to hire someone to do the gardening.
一膳食，一瓢饮，一家人，一辈子👍
采菊东篱下，悠然见南山
看菜量最多有4人 份
If you're getting lazy and don't know how to start the day, just watch Liziqi's and you'll be energized too js like her😅
Bamboo is sooooo good and you just go pick it up like and here it's so expensive :( I don't even know how people could survive at these areas there's nothing else to eat besides some berries and mushrooms on fall. Over there you have nature providing you everything.
Bà dịch giả nào mà lầy zữ zậy😆yêu bả nhìu ❤
好美的生活谢谢你
죽순 크기가 엄청나네;;
When I started to watch her videos, I no longer want an extravagant life. Sml ❤️
妳太美了吧這個畫面一舉一動
So beautiful that I want to cry
تعرفي غايا طيبي 👾
啊啊啊想吃！！！！！
你家乡真好。青山绿水就是金山银山，Green mountains and clear waters are gold and silver.
漂亮又贤惠。。。
看饿了。
馋哭了
看不懂评论
李子柒~總是給人總清新脫俗，傳統中國女性的美。能幹了不起的形象!!  
請李小姐繼續加油!!  做更多更多優質純樸的中國風視頻，來教育更多人~  感謝有妳的付出!!
你让舌尖上的中国找的那些洋拍摄怎么活？
Rindu masa kecil, tenang tanpa beban dan banyak kebutuhan ingin ini dan itu
Great stuff!
自然美
Quietly do the things in hand, not disturbed by the impetuous life of the outside world. Fantastic!!!!
Very ingenious design with the fermentation jars and water

I saw 1 video of this woman, and i fell in love and subbed asap. This is what a real woman looks like! Is she married yet?😂😂👌
먹고싶다..한국음식이랑 좀 비슷한듯..
01.37 aku masih melek nonton ini.betapa indahnya hidup nenek itu....apakah dia cucunya? Alangkah indah di saat tua hidup tenang di desa dengan berkah anak atau cucu seperti wanita ini🥰
很棒！
Heathy food, I guess you have a pharmacy in your garden, When someone Begin to seeing your videos he can't stopped until he finish it
Besar sekali rebungnya
这视频是假的，怎么可能有榨菜？不可能！那是人吃得起的？
这生活。。。。。

话说，螺蛳粉是我们在寝室和印度人煮咖喱进行对抗的终极武器！
这神仙播放量啊
那只狗估计是全天下最幸福的狗...
子柒小姐姐好美啊
别的不说，川妹子真的是好看
I microwaved a damn hot pocket while watching this, jesus.
你的手是干活人的手？
nossa lugar lindo a ponto de ser quase magico,,,,uma mulher fantastica .......falar mais o que, eu sempre fico  em paz quando assisto
hello I'm from Indonesia .. I like your video, you are also beautiful and charming .. I love you .. nice to meet you from Indonesia
Bất kể là làm đậu phụ, tương ớt, thịt bò khô hay hấp cua, mọi video của Lý Tử Thất, cô gái 29 tuổi sở hữu 7,5 triệu người theo dõi trên Youtube và khoảng 20 triệu người hâm mộ trên Weibo, đều chất chứa nét hoài cổ và thắp lên khao khát về cuộc sống yên bình chốn thôn quê,
Your garden looks like an island of all ingredients...Big sis😃
有什么想不通的要大晚上来看这个视频 简直是自虐！！
I love Ur grandma she's so sweet and lovely
احسن شئ ان والدتها عايشة مثل الملكة 😍😍😍😍
That is the most delicious video I’ve ever watched
Subtitles: "Careful when replicating this at home"


Me: it aint gonna happen anyway
天啊螺蛳粉
mong được một lần ăn đồ của bạn nấu, hihi
Bamboo girl :)
Njirr Gw salah server lagi
众所周知, 吃螺蛳粉第一步就是挖笋开始.....看得我瞬间就要去煮一包螺蛳粉压压惊
国产李子柒
미슐렝 3스타의 최고급 호텔 음식보다 더 좋아보이는 요리네요💕
柳州人民感谢你把螺蛳粉推广给全世界！
Everything is natural and perfect 👌..💐💐💐🌸🌸
Yes, I am a Chinese. Those dishes are edible after pickling! It tastes good! Sour, crisp😄
狗屎玩意 ， 岁月静好婊太贪心了已经主动被CCP招安充当大外宣了么 哈哈哈
儘管我身邊都是中國美食，但我是真沒吃過螺蛳粉...
口水直流
From VietNam with love
"Careful when replicating this at home. We dont want fermented fingertips and nails"
Me: oh Liziqi got jokes huh? 😘😂
为什么做田螺菜的步骤少了剪尾巴的片段？（^0^）
So claming!🌸🌸🌸
柳州螺蛳粉这几年非常畅销，吃过一次就欲罢不能
1、螺蛳粉放油爆辣椒是异端邪教。
2、干粉是先泡再煮，才会整体Q弹而不糊。
3、煮粉要放盐。
4、酸笋拌辣椒粉也是异端邪教。
She can't die of hunger even without money. I respect her intelligence
纯粹就是卖柳州螺蛳粉 的广告。但是这个比那位抓鱼的大叔高明多了，但是目的都是一样的，都是为了点击率，为了给自己赚钱。这个柳州螺蛳粉 在超市里买过，太太太难吃了。因为是捆绑销售，一次必须买四包，吃一半，扔一半。
I’m surprised that no one has commented about the giant wok she’s been using in all her videos? It is a typical Fixed appliance for rural Chinese households from the very south of Hainan province to the north point at inner magnolia, I have seen giant woks like the one she is using.
这竹笋好大
That video quality though.
You already know she's gonna be one of those people who lives forever
老人还能吃动辣椒吗？
宝藏女孩
Finally some good hecking food
子柒真的很棒！微博上关注了好久，又来到了这里！喜欢你的视频，加油！
Snails: 
Liziqi: Y E E T *throws them into wok*
Deu vontade de ir embora do Brasil e casar com ela.
Parabéns  vc mora num paraíso  !!
奶奶好幸福呀
힘이 장사시내요.팬입니다..
""Eid Mubarak🌙""everyone.😊😊😊enjoy your eid day with happiness...God bless you all...
Who would not eat at this woman’s table! Makes me hungry every time!
Não pode comer caramujo, essas coisas tem doenças. 😱
Kalo di indonesia ini namanya rebung dan jamur kuping 😁
老婆！
切る音、鈴虫や水の流れる音、映像も相まって夏の清涼感がたまらない。bgmともマッチして美しい。無料で観れることに感謝ですわ
I know why there has 10k dislikes, Because other youtubers wearing miniskirts can't attract everyone's attention.😂
Cô ấy rất giỏi.👍
I’ve never get bored to see her video.
近饭点，看着饿了
祝福婆婆身體健康、長命百歲……❤❤，也祝福柒姑娘永遠青春美麗……🌷🌷（那簍竹筍應該不輕，辛苦妳了，真的好賢慧……👍👍）
Vc vietsub :v
no words can praise it .amazing.
This is your 1st video I'm seeing. You just gained a new subby. Neatly presented dishes
I'm dead.
子柒每次看你的视频特别的治愈，特别是在国外让人产生浓浓的思乡情。谢谢你！“螺蛳粉特别的好吃”😋😋
افولكي لخيراد تنميرت يكرا يمازيغن
Ohh the witch house... How amazing

Your pee is going to smell the same
The best wife you can find.
榨菜，茶叶蛋，泡面，子柒 你这样炫富好吗？
人间有味是清欢
纯色啊 洒满
螺蛳粉要火到世界了 😂🌚🌝
看得我啊，再吃一个苹果吧，其他没有了，都吃了
I may not be able to live just like her but she inspires me to do more myself and rely on stores just a bit less.  Raised garden beds, fix things, use natural items, etc.
加油！
bought this liziqi luosifen from tmall shop when I am watching this vidio. this is that kind of food you smell it you hate it, after first bite you will fall in love with it.
Beautiful bamboo forest, i love china 🧡🧡🧡😁😁😁
음식이 이렇게 아름다울 수 가 ~~
What I like so bad and it is so impressive she never uses" Plastic" no harming nature💚
Terribly wish I could join that bliss  for only one day !
damai sekali video nih, rasanya kepingin hidup kayak gini
love from Jiangning District, Nanjing City, Jiangsu Province, P.R.C.
Thank God for 2 minute noodles!!!
把这些老外馋蒙了
就视频而言：我们活在尘世，公主活在童话，而你 生活在诗里。当然，现实没那么美好，但你让我们在视频中 体验了一下，对我们观众而言 足够了！谢谢，加油。
要不说普通家庭做不出这样的东西呢，成本够你去买10份螺蛳粉了
She and I are from the same place, and our hometown is not what she has shown. All rural Chinese are not at all her poetic life, everything is a hoax. She is the tool chosen and packaged by the Chinese Communist Party for the export of foreign culture
These videos have great cinematography
Pertahankan,, 👍🙂
She’s got a shit ton Of produce but wat really is impressive that she finds a way to preserve it
Orang indo mana..?
專業拍攝團隊
来这里看看你
孝😭
I admire this lady for her hard work and beauty, besides caring her aged grandmother.
The food looks so amazing!
Она, что  всё то что готовит, только на себя и бабушку??? Не понятно кто живёт с ними еще в таком хорошем доме, с  таким изысканным меню на каждый  день, интересно даже? :-)

Even some dishes aren’t look like delicious I’m still watching. I love how she cook.
This is so beatiful, so well made, with that much care... it’s hard not to fall in love with this channel.
馋了
My all time favorite series of videos to watch.  The food looks amazing and the scenery is breathtaking.
너무 이쁘시네요~~ ♡♡
Miyang bibiniannya mun kaya itu,,,
中国哪里还有这样的净土？求大佬指点？
Does she do the camera angles too Ann's editing because that's really good aswell.
What a place to live and cook
归去来兮，田园将芜胡不归？既自以心为形役，奚惆怅而独悲？悟已往之不谏，知来者之可追。实迷途其未远，觉今是而昨非。舟遥遥以轻飏，风飘飘而吹衣。问征夫以前路，恨晨光之熹微。 
乃瞻衡宇，载欣载奔。僮仆欢迎，稚子候门。三径就荒，松菊犹存。携幼入室，有酒盈樽。引壶觞以自酌，眄庭柯以怡颜。倚南窗以寄傲，审容膝之易安。园日涉以成趣，门虽设而常关。策扶老以流憩，时矫首而遐观。云无心以出岫，鸟倦飞而知还。景翳翳以将入，抚孤松而盘桓。 
归去来兮，请息交以绝游。世与我而相违，复驾言兮焉求？悦亲戚之情话，乐琴书以消忧。农人告余以春及，将有事于西畴。或命巾车，或棹孤舟。既窈窕以寻壑，亦崎岖而经丘。木欣欣以向荣，泉涓涓而始流。善万物之得时，感吾生之行休。 
已矣乎！寓形宇内复几时？曷不委心任去留？胡为乎遑遑欲何之？富贵非吾愿，帝乡不可期。怀良辰以孤往，或植杖而耘耔。登东皋以舒啸，临清流而赋诗。聊乘化以归尽，乐夫天命复奚疑！

The best channel in YouTube unlike some channel she didn't even have to promote her channel to her subscribers once you are here its contagious...btw love every single episode of your video, I'm from a from a small town of Meghalaya, India I'm tribal  we have some cuisine similarity.

How can you eat that river snail without cutting its tail?
這是我第一次看李子柒您的視頻，我看到一根白白的似乎是筍子的東西，一個女孩正在處理它的網頁封面。看完以後我就決定訂閱她了，後面就越看越多，看到李子柒接受微博的專訪，看到網友見面會........等等等。在YouTube李子柒可能看不到我的留言，因為我是台北人。只希望下次能一起玩一起談天。
看了好几个视频，怎么也不加广告呀，加广告才有收益
Whoever is married to this woman is one lucky dude!
She is a real artisan. 
This like what my Grandma and Mother used to do, everything from scratch. Wonderful.
吃的人开心 闻的人伤心😂
是不是吃不起
Iwung...
这是用农村体材有制作有导演专业拍的而矣、真正的农民是永远过不起这样的生活的
谢谢高质量视频。
我好馋啊
Да они обжоры! Куда столько жрать?😯😂
dáng cô mà đào  nổi củ sen à hihi nhưng cô thật giỏi ,chỉ đáng tiếc cô không đọc được tiếng việt
Wow this lady is amazing
почему она обязательно должна быть безумно красива?
不是竹笋吗？为啥是莴笋？
采菊东篱下，悠然见南山。
I don't know what brings me here but I love watching all the videos in this channel. Amazing!
小时候奶奶也腌豆角
这就是人杰地灵吧
老婆，你咋跑山里去了，快点回来洗衣服，做饭。
0:56
I’m pretty sure she made enough food to feed the film crew too!
Come to watch Li Ziqi's videos on Youtube cuz recently there's a heated debate about her on Chinese Internet. Actually I heard of her long time ago, but this is my first time to watch her videos.
Is she accepting applications for marriage? 🥰🥰🥰
This video was sooo relaxing but I'm not gonna lie I stood to the end because man she was soo beautiful 😍😍😍
感觉像拍片，而非真实生活啊
太厉害了，竟然从原材料开始做螺蛳粉~  看的口水直流，景美，食美，手艺美，人更美！！！
Não gostei muito do último prato kkkk
cho tôi xin cánh tay ng vn đi
What is it with Asian woman!
Gorgeous 😍
Ngno kui ng omah ku jenenge BUNG, marai kelingan mbahku biyen gaene masak jangan bung enak eram 👍
I think about how much fake food I eat and how weak I always feel... This almost makes me cry. Someday I'm going to live like this too. Its beautiful.

Very serene to watch her work away, and her preparations look so intricate and delicious .
很有意境，这种生活田园生活真的好棒
Man.... just take me there with her...and I’ll leave my job and shitty things in city life...it’s so peaceful and absolutely satisfying.....
Buenísimo china cultura, comidas  ,mujeres  fascinantes 👍😎🐉🈴
新垣结衣给你们了，李子柒是我老婆
子柒妳好，妳的影片好好看，尤其是妳種的植物，都好漂亮，但有一事想請問你，妳採得蓮藕，竹筍，只要是踏出妳的家園，妳所採的各種水果，都是妳家種的，還是自然生長的，我看ㄌ覺得住在那裏好幸福喔，同時也祝福妳幸福成功，(來自台灣粉絲)
小时候我奶奶也经常做酸豇豆，酸笋。可惜奶奶离开二十年了。妈妈也离开7年了。再也找不到熟悉的味道
子柒，好羡慕你能在大自然中生活，每天能吸收大自然的能量，吃有机食物，谢谢你分享给我们大自然的美。
不知道哪里可以找到你这样的媳妇
so hungry🤤
传承中国文化，加油。。。
抱歉，螺狮粉做的再诱人我也接受不了😂😂😂
This makes me feel like moving to no where and just being like this haha
Liziqi kinda looks like mina from twice 🤔
家里这么多泡菜坛子！是大户人家没错了lol
Marry me? :)
看完我终于知道她火的原因了，就是一种对纯粹的需求，因为长期缺乏且越来越缺，越来越多人缺，从获取食材到加工到最后成品，很多人在除了欣赏一段手工美食的制作过程之外更重要的是一种联想：这种离自己现在生活越是遥远越又向往的纯粹感确实是不少人最想找一个时间和空间做的事情，但可惜多数人都是事与愿违，而她确实在这方面满足了这些事与愿违的人的念想。
Why this video have so many dislikes?? I mean, wtff
This explains the Vietnam War ecology
Dam im hungry now.
I like eating bamboo shoots so much...but never taken it direct from its growing place...so fresh! 


It's the first time I see the grandma relaxing herself by sitting on the swing...
From Viet Nam with love
來自台灣的問候  妳 好美 手藝超群  又很有 復古風 真的 越看越美 妳的每一集都有看 希望你能常常出片 祝妳順心 愉快
All these looks so familiar.Yes, we came from the same place
这是哪？是中国南方么

Bamboo shoots is one of the most popular recipe in northeast India.. Love from northeast India.our culture something like China Thailand maynmer etc
好美
Liuzhou snail noodle is welcome to taste!
I Love nature but no chance visit Nature Place...............
Lord this is a sexy vid . . . what an elegant looking lady!
这种回归自然的生活方式，
真令人回味。。
返璞归真，甭担心化学物质，过度的加工，防腐，香料色素。。
那树干制成的盘子，木料勺子让我爱死了。。
能有这种机会到这样纯朴的地方住上几天，舒解城市人扛在背上，闷在心里的压力，多好！～
四川改良版的#柳州螺蛳粉😄

What else is there to learn?? Everything she is doing independently...she's not wasting even a single grass.....my God....no words to say about her....
that is the biggest bamboo I have ever seen
未來的人類都是宅經濟吧 小兵立大功啊
I wish I am there
找个老公过日子吧，一个人干活美则美矣，仙也够仙，未必显得孤寂清冷

评论的老外，有几个问过螺蛳粉酸笋的味道？我在想如何能在学生宿舍里吃螺蛳粉而不会被意大利人赶出去…
有茶叶蛋有榨菜，有点吃不起啊
画面好唯美
❤
Admiro.
Wow I am in love
Would love to taste.
I am so hungary...
作为柳州人我想说正宗的螺蛳粉没有那么多乱七八糟的配菜  花生 腐竹 酸笋 青菜就够了
Cho e hỏi tí nhé
This has a different feel. New camera? Different editing?
What a wonderful crockpot
Tell you what😂, in fact,she’s the most beautiful country girl I’ve seen. (I am a country boy from mainland China)Most country girls suffer from the exhausting farming work and their husbands’ disrespect,they get old quickly, my mom does(but I love her)
я слюной изошелся !!! умница!
😍
We eat bamboo shoots too...with pork, fish , chicken, pickle, with fermented fish etc etc

Life like this is a dream...God gave everything to survive easily but we make everything so difficult..Such a peaceful life..so refreshing.
"Baby Yoda" can learn from her
cả đời tôi vẩn thường mơ về một cuộc sống như thế này, nơi mà tiền không phải là tất cả 😊
很好奇这些外国人能否真的看懂？还是仅仅喜欢这样的风情？
妹子 ，YouTube玩这么久第一次看到你，还是饿肚子看
What a beautiful video.
nhìn tưởng ở viet nam nữa chứ
I want to know what camera her team is using. Any prediction photographers??
Hi Liziqi I'm your big fan from Philippines 😘
ela é muito FOFA!!
Talk about eating organic food!
Welcome to China, welcome to Sichuan, it’s full of yummy food and it’s such a peaceful and relaxing place. Then you will know the real China.
One word to say beautiful
I wish one day before I die I could go there and live with you for a day.  Its a paradise on earth.
The true Chinese foods....👍👍
谁能告诉我评论区怎么翻译不了了，其实更想看的是外国友人的评论，奈何文化水平不够😥
婆婆好口福
What a good chinese name you have
I ever once put chilli in the fire, then I made the entire people in the house sneezing 😂

把乡村生活渲染的好美啊，但我宁愿待在城市里享受现代化生活带来的舒适和便利，然后坐在城市的月光下欣赏她的“田园生活”
谁有本事娶这位仙女？真是天大的福分。
李子柒
This is my first time exploring this channel.. You're really pretty, talented and already my favourite, you're magical ❤❤
밥 먹은지 한시간뿐이 안지낫는데 또 배고프네  刚吃完饭一个小时又饿了，怎么办呢？
молодец девушка! золотые руки!
李子柒 Liziqi > Gordon Ramsay
How I wish I could live a life like that😁😊☹️😩😣😖😔
Liziqi did super cool job. But i have to appreciate the cameraman too. The scenes of the frog and view of sunshine is amazing.
睡一晚多少钱？
My dad used to live in the same rural area in Sichuan China, and he told me many ways to cook like several staffs in this video, and I am able to make sour beans and sour bamboo root myself, learned from my dad. There are still many Chinese ppl living in that way, instead of nice, peace, organic, deliciousness shown in this video, that's really hard working and way too difficult in real life.
Herşey iyi güzel ama sen yemek yapma .
This is true life.. Money can't buy us happiness... Small things matters a lot.. Bless this lady in Jesus name.. Amen
I wonder, how you carry yourself with so much talent 💕 

Lots and lots of love for you 😍😍
国人来助力
I wish she had a contest to have a dinner with her and have her cat and dog as company!
This woman is just like my wife, perfect.
Wwww interesting.....😍😍😍😋😋😋😋
看得我半夜点了个螺蛳粉外卖。
Wow Nice me from Nepal
I've heard that bamboo can be harder than steel so how can one eat it!
这是在哪里？
Very smart girl... Luv u
I'm a fan from Vietnam
Your videos have been popular in there
这只代表中国南方农村好吗……有兴趣来东北农村看看.......莲花乡呲水沟子那种
羡慕而奢侈的农村生活，好不容易走出来的我们，该如何回去曾经的生活
Só cruel to fry alive a living being...thank God for karma

这个女人上山采菜，下河抓螺蛳，烧柴煮饭，动作轻盈又熟练，一看就是经常干这些活的人，但是在她身上却看不到任何劳动的痕迹，她的气质安静温婉，手脚也白白嫩嫩的像个富家小姐，这造就了很强的画面感，不得不说她和她的团队真的很厉害，我想这就是诗人笔下归隐田园的生活样貌，就像海子的那句诗，从今天起，做个幸福的人，喂马劈柴，环游世界。
Please English Title! I always wait for your new videos!
Look yummy
李子柒不用管现在国内那些关于你的闲言碎语，做好你自己就行。央视都在挺你呢

is Chinese bamboo not itchy??
 
bamboo around my place are full of spiky tiny fur that can get everywhere, taste bitter like my life if you don't boil it properly too... it so hard to cook elegantly like this 

if there's big strong sweet and easy to handle bamboo like this exist, can you please give me species name of it? I love bamboo  
thank you

Tutut rebung kacang
Living style is similar with the north eastern part of india...lots of love from nagaland..😊
I don’t usually watch these videos to know how to cook things, I watch them because they make me wonder how living this type of lifestyle feels like. It’s just so interesting
When does she have time to work on her kung fu? 😲😲😲🐈🐈🐈😎😎😎
今日も癒されました✨
リーズーチーさんのような暮らしをするのが夢になりました✨

这么多粉丝，太强了
How I wish I could live her life. Even I cannot grow houseplants. Everything dies in my hand.
I really miss luosifen. 我很想螺蛳粉. 我住在柳州的时候我每天都吃螺蛳粉。
you can imagine how busy it would be, to make a such relaxing video
oh，her videos are the best of Chinese traditional food ，i promise.Not only because of her beauty,but also her videos let me know so much about traditional food and traditional culture in countryside,which i hardly heard before.As you can see im a chinese.
IDAMAN
I just got to know her today.  I watched a few today. She is so amazing.  At first, I have so many questions I cannot believe she can shot a movie like this all by herself!!! It is better than anything I watched before, even from many well funded organizations and commercials.  But later I got to hear her story from another sources, I am so admire her!  Her parents divorced and she lived with her Daddy, but her daddy passed away when she was five.  She then was raised by her grandparents in countryside.  At 14, she had to leave for city to make a living.  Learned many skills and chose back home to take care of her only grandma.  Shot the movie by herself alone, very difficult but first few nobody noticed her until one.  Now she hired camera man shot for her...  I have to say her food must be better than any Michelin’s restaurant.  She is the best chef, artist, farmers, movie director!!
美
I accidentally clicked on this video ..I'm glad I did that
Beautiful sister thanks
Được có vùng thôn quê như vậy tôi cúng chọn như thế.

They make sure you can't replicate the food
This is Sichuan，where pandas live. So you can see so many bamboos here
😍😍😍
No one:
Liziqi: *picks up literally anything* I can make something with this
Yummy!
Wanita asia sangat pintar

这女孩像极了仙女下凡。
太晚看到這個頻道了！ 然後妳好漂亮....
How to fall in love with someone in 10:05 minutes.
When she picked the mushrooms I fell in love. Feels like I'm missing out on life eating my can of tamales.
She's absolutely beautiful!
I wanna save up and just go live with her lol
she is so cute <3
Dude she makes me feel so lazy on my busiest days!
👏☺ How Beautiful. I could immerse myself in those bamboo forests for all time! 💜🌿🌿🌿
AAAAAAAAA the amount of oil used in the sauce terrifies me
If it's the end of the world, one of my top priority will be searching for Liziqi... I'm sure I'll survive...
Such a simple and beautiful way to live
Came here for some relaxing entertainment, now I'm hungry as hell xD . Great video regardless :)
The land she lives on and walks on to harvest all her items is SO beautiful!  Where in China is this?  I want to go there.  I would love to try some of her cooking too!  Everything she makes looks delicious and truly I thought I'd never say that about snails.
大爱柳州螺蛳粉
Not only are your videos interesting but beautifuly done, it's a pleasure to learn your culture with such good videos. Thank you very much for that.
2000多万的观看，太恐怖了
I like this new concept of cooking video, so calming, got a bit of story too
Excellent I truly enjoyed these videos!!
Warning !
Watching these videos can cause calmness, joyfulness, lower blood pressure and a strong urges to meditate. 🧘‍♂️
Thank you .🙏🙏🙏
The purest form of living there is. Is was the original plan of how we where supposed to live out our lives. Somewhere along the line we became very lost.
短片拍的非常的漂亮☺️
What a wonderful woman every time she Uploads my heart skips a beat <3 <3 ... <3. Keep it up ! ^^
She eats primitive but has a high quality expensive camera love it!
Apakah mereka hanya hidup berdua dengan orang tua nya? Entahlah tapi ini keren abis gilakkkk!!!!
I was thinking 7 11 slurpie, duh
Meanwhile..
I have a land full of tumbleweeds and cacti
I am a girl n i really wants to meet her n be my teacher
이 영상을 보고 있으면. 기분이 좋아 지네요,,
น่ารักแถมเก่งด้วย
she goes everywhere barefoot? amazing
看她的视频总会让人宁静下来
那些吃过假螺丝粉的，来这里看看什么才是螺丝粉
原来国外也那么多人喜欢这个节目😄
This is a team work. A person couldn't have done this. I come from Chinese countryside. I know almost every dish they made.
Relaxing to watch
Epicurean delight!
Bende böyle herşeyimi kendim yapabileceğim bi yerde bulunayım isterdim
10k people jealous they cant cook like this babe
อยากได้คำแปล ภาษาไทยจัง
The beauty that is put into the filming of this is amazing. Been vegan for 55 years everything is perfect but the animal that's not alive in here. But if somebody chose and had the land they could live this way without the animal added. There could be videos of how to make tofu or eat beans. She certainly has a large enough Garden to create any version of this that anybody would love. This still has less dead animals in a Burger King commercial. I'll focus on the garden in the bamboo forest and hope that all that waste gets composted.

I'm not familiar with what she's cooking but it looks delicious.

I envy the life you have. Simple living no comlexities, just being with mother nature.
It used to be like this man was just uncontented and turned into a life full of difficulties.
like my dream home :) that is a lot of trees a lot of vegetables and can also make a garden be
Nice garden. How many people is she feeding with all that food ?
Such a fine woman. I hope I can meet her in person. ❤
I love the sound her clay pot makes when she places the clay lid its so satisfying 🤓🤓
คนไทยโว้ยยยยย . ❤❤❤
Здоровая пища - залог здоровья !
i've been following your channel for almost a year 👌🏻 every time i watch your videos, my soul is relaxing and filling with peace 🌿love that feeling and i hope your channel keep growing. with lots of love and good wishes from Turkey.
Do you like her ?? 
Yes = like 
No = comment
O sea que la vida de la china es basicamente laburar todo el dia cocinando
Em đến từ Việt Nam. Rất nhiều người thích xem video của chị. Chị làm phụ đề tiếng Việt đi ạ
I really like the "luosifen" but take out of the spicy source. Haha ~
😍😍😍
Bạn quá xinh
Do you do the oil? Or do they buy it?
That bamboo shoot we call it "Labong" here in philippines.  It's yummy when you cook it with coconut milk 😋
老家那的我去你那边玩
Netflix needs to hook you up with your own series.
I get now why silk is so expensive
I am so impressed by this woman. Her knowledge and skill makes me feel like a child.
Did she .....
Did she just GROW HER OWN SILKWORMS to make a comforter ????

#shook 😱
watching all the videos made me wonder "what have I done for 21 years of my life?"
That simple silk sweater is way more expensive than any premium designer label dress.
子柒最漂亮，老奶奶最可爱！
第一次看这种工艺 太厉害了、、、、、佩服
好想好想做子柒的邻居 那我也会跟她学到好多好多
Wow! I'm speechless. You're an amazing young lady.
Honestly, the fact that Studio Ghibli music from Princess Mononoke is playing in the background is so fitting for this video
好感动
これは私が理想と暖かいの生活が、现実は残酷な、さっき社长に叱られない仕事を満たせず、悲しくて
太喜欢你的视频了，好有爱心，好能干啊
I'm hooked to her videos now. The time, patience, love, and skill that goes into everything she does is so beautifully amazing. Forever a fan from Florida
This is 1000x better than nowadays ''famous'' youtubers running those ''popular'' trends. Keep up the amazing work! <3
蚕丝被原来是这样做的，长见识了
哇賽~影片中的美女還有什麼不會的，也太強了吧！
雖然蠶寶寶多的有點嚇人，好密集呀⋯⋯（放錯重點，哈哈~
你把乡下的日子过得这么诗和远方
煮蚕丝的时候放了什么？来消毒！
All the hard work was only to comfy a grandmother, how a good girl you are!
I really miss my grandpa and grandma after watching this video.
我惊了，蚕丝都有
For anyone who might be concerned: 
When they're pupating like that, they aren't even alive. They didn't feel pain and they didn't suffer. Plus! This isn't even standard way of getting silk anymore so if you're like me and feel bad watching this video, you don't need to be :)!
I really want to live with her it so peaceful just the 2 of them no one to nag and ruin thier peace 😍😍
With the price of a yard of silk fabric, the idea of a conforter made entirely out of silk is a bogling though.   I imagine thats kind of thing is passed down family and well taken care off
I’m the only one who’s even more in love with this video because she used Mononoke ost?
妳好，这个视频好像没上载到抖音对吧？
这个太强了吧！蚕丝被原来是这么做出来的。看着都觉得很温暖。
李子柒好孝顺，多才多艺，做事又专注。她的attention span是比绝大多数现代人长多少啊？！
小柒还有你不会的吗？我的天啊啥都会，这样的媳妇才叫媳妇！
My parents want to send me abroad but suddenly I feel like going back to my village
Wah this is amazing! I’m so impressed by ur hard work!!!
So homegirl over here made a mattress with her bear hands
子柒心灵手巧啊！！！👍👍👍👍👍👍赞赞👍赞赞赞·
Những người đàn bà thế này ở việt nam còn k mơ ước lấy đc cô vợ như này
No wonder why silk is so expensive.
谢谢子柒！您带给我心中丝丝的温暖！
我奶奶也是這樣養蟬寶寶…做蟬絲被…
我爸爸在旁吃蟬蛹，當零食吃…
I like so match the way how you love ur grandmother good girl 😙
Wonder whose daughter in law she would be.....?
Person like her is rear so natural I love everything about her......may God bless her
Beautiful ❤️ yaaar osm vedio from Pakistan 🇵🇰

Hats off to this young woman! Her energy, skills and wisdom is simply amazing! She is the real Wonder Woman!💜
好讚哦。
I can just puke after seeing a dead silkworm rather alone taking out a dead silkworm 
李子柒should just stay inside fictional stories.
大開眼界了 eye opening!!!
すごい…こんなにふわふわ…絶対気持ちよくてあったかい
*feeds the silk worms*
*takes care of them*
*DROWNS THE SILK WORMS IN BOILING HOT WATER*
Wow that is the first time seeing it how it was started , love it .
i really wanna finish school and go to her and live like her,  although it's hard,  it seems fun
I love these videos and I admire her so much. I wish I had a fraction of her skills. 

Did anyone else notice the studio ghibli song in the background?
يالله  شنو انتي فنااااانه بمعنى الكلمه 👍
anyone else notice Princess Mononoke theme music playing in the background?
Her grandmom works with her till the night, incredible
God has totally given us a means and a way for everything . Beautiful.  Thank you God. You're a good good Father.
ชอบมากค่ะอยากไปยุที่บ้านเลย
I didn’t even know it could be processed like that.
What a beautiful life i wish i could live like that
Does anyone know the song when the video starts at the beginning? It sounds beautiful.
I truly love you content. I cant figure out why it always makes me so emotional. Maybe it's the peaceful & calm vibe compared to my stressful city life...idk but I get misty eyed in every one of your videos. Nostalgic for a life I've never lived.
美女妳的視頻讓我大開眼界~對妳視訊讚賞有方，成功不是偶然的~祝福妳👍👍
To think this was once a top state secret in ancient China
Just fantatistic, u got a pure silk coat and cover like princesses
Amazing and smart girl
مشاء الله بارة بأمها  الله يسلمك ويحفظك
Omg, I would love to try this but those worms. I'm squeamish about those things
Her way of life is so wildly different from the majority, I would love to reach it some day
子柒你泄密了
Here we go again can't control my self to watch this video..
真了不起👏👍
好温暖的视频
Next thing you'll know: She created her own camera to film all these vids.
We used to eat the cocoon actually.... thank you so much for I learn how to utilize it...love u Liziqi
Aw, so sweet ! For her grandma! <3 Well done girl !
Such as blessed blessings to see you and your family live life as naturally of the land. Jah bless you and your family Ameni
Cô ấy rất là khoé tay và giỏi quá. Thật ngưỡng mộ.
Just wow 😍the end is so cute
Thank You for this Love moment! Magnifiquement tendre
It's so interesting 😮
me: *sees silk cocoons* oh cool
*then i realize there are dead silkworms inside them*
Wait.... rest in peace silk worms. Your silk cocoons are in good hands


Not that I care but someone had to say something for their sacrifice



Amazing, beautiful and well crafted btw I love your work you are so talented ❤️❤️❤️❤️
How incredible silkworms is?
This is all I have been on the internet for
这才叫与世界交流
Вот она Любовь в чистом виде.
I wanna live with her for at least a year. I am sure upon my return,  I will be a different person
你的童年一定很充實
What a talent lady I never see b4 god bless you n love you..
Akorean friend once told me about silk quilts how,beautiful and expensive they were,I can really appreciate the work.
She is truly amazing! The bond Liziqi and her Grandmother has is beautiful! Keep up the great work! ❤
Granny must be happy to have such a nice person to see her beloved person build her own dreams to amuse her before she parts from earth
Well, I don't know how anything works or where anything comes from O..O .  Liziqi is so impressive, thank you for showing us city folk the origin of our daily items!
She is her own world
She grow her food
She stich her clothes
She make furniture for herself
What else
God's perfect creation Liziqi
سبحان من علمك هذا وأعطاك الصبر للقيام به أكل صحي ولباس صحي وبر بوالدتها اوجدتها لاندري لغياب الترجمة ،ممكن ترجمة للعربي أو الفرنسي او حتى للإنجليزيliziqi????
Omg you're so good at everything
just realized  she was wearing shorts when picking the leaves and then she was wearing thick coats when quilting... so it took a whole year to make this vid 😮
BGM也好好聽👍
其实，中国200年前都是这样过活的。
Shes an amazing woman. I envy her.
I want to live like her.. In my place I have to buy every single thing..
i will need to meet you in the future, I need lots to learn from you .By the way I am an agriculture student
Fun fact: in China, almost every child keeps some silkworms in the primary school, cause it is taught in the science class
QUE MUJER TAN INCREÍBLE, TAN INSPIRACIONAL !!!!!!! ME HACE RECORDAR LO ÚNICO E IMPORTANTE DE LA VIDA POR LO CUAL DEBA DE PREOCUPARME; DIOS Y SUS MAGNÍFICOS REGALOS , LA FAMILIA Y LA NATURALEZA!!!!!!
Oh my god... Am wondering about her dedication towards her work....never ever seen such a talented girl who is active until her work is over... Love you liziqi 😚😚
she did all that work to end up giving the blanket to her grandmother.......just wow. i am speechless at this amazing woman
Silk is  luxury in any age, really luxury ！
娶妻當娶李子柒
اذا في عربي موجود حطو لايك 🤩👍
我小时候跟我奶奶做过 现在的小孩子基本都不会了
There is so much beauty in what this woman does for her family and community. Her commitment to them and to the old ways is literally breathe taking.. Watching her video's brings hope and joy to so many of us who watch. I personally would give up my life here in the USA to live the remainder of days, living to assist her, in all she does.. to be a student of what she knows in that way of life, on a daily bases.. I am blessed just knowing some one with her devotions and work ethics being a good steward of the earth, it's animals and its People. I aspire.
Maravilhoso esse canal...Tô encantada e viciada em assistir...🥰🥰🥰🥰🌸🌸🌸🌸🌿🌿🌿
I wish a granddaughter like her💕🥰
婆婆在帮忙，好可爱哦
Grandma is doing great. ❤️
all this work for some silk, wow, i sure will think twice about stealing from the silk trader in runescape from now on.
2:32 Princess Mononoke
I can safely say that we can all learn from her. Watching the work she puts in is astounding and hypnotic. My parents would be proud of this work than the work I do now lol
I like how there are youtube channels for tradition methods of making things because its nice to preserve appreciate these things. It may be a slightly romanticized way but it also gives us a record of how things used to be done. And it is super peaceful to watch
Omg cada día miro esta chica y no paro de verla es increíble todo lo que hace omg es increíble y es tan linda asombrosa me encanta como cuida su granma.
This is so wholesome, educational, and breathtaking to watch. Thank you!
I really enjoyed this ❤️👍🏻
못하는게 뭐야 ㄷㄷ
（養蚕して一から布団や服をほぼ１人で作ってしまうとは…）たまげたなぁ…
Making me realize how hard the workers work just to get silk for cloths etc..and she also portrays a mom's endless job..
Every video I watch of hers, I feel like I haven’t done anything productive with my life
unbelievable! I feel greatly moved... what a wonderful skill!
She is very talented young girl.. hard working and dedicated ☺️
I somehow felt bad for the worms being boiled to death, though I am a non-vegetarian ...
From all her videos this one is the coolest! And I enjoy watching the process. This is sheets from scratch!!!
I wish I grew up like this. In the mountains, surrounded by animals, fruit trees and fresh air. I would've traded in this life for the one I have in a split second. I hate growing up in the city... people belong in nature. People in the city are miserable and depressed. A life surrounded by nature and fresh air, learning skills to produce important things and living with your family- that is a wonderful, peaceful life. Watching these videos always makes me cry.
She's really Amazing 😍😍😱
妳好棒
Waw, super le résultat magnifiques.
Impresionante el trabajo y el arte de conocimiento.. Saludos  chile..
竟然从养蚕开始，这得养多少蚕啊
中國女性的魅力
Love u liziqi..when u give respect to ur grand mom.
This is amazing.
Here is the translation of the conversation: 
Stretching the silk on bench:
         Grandma (looking at the silk): This looks warm.
         Girl (taking to the camera man): Xiaogang, tripod the camera and come to help us.
         Camera man：OK.
         Girl: Mingguo (assistant), Can you help us?
         Girl : let’s pull this to the corner. Perfect. Granny go to that way (please).
At night. 
         Girl(making bed): This quilt gives you warm sleep.  
         Grandma (touching the quilt): It's warm. 
         Girl: Good night granny.
         Grandma: Good night.
Next morning. 
         Girl (knocking door): Granny do you wake up? I made you new clothes, if it suits you, i will wash it for you. 
         Grandma (trying to button up): This button can not be tightened. 
         Girl (laughing): Granny you matched wrong buttons. Let me help you.
         Grandma: Oh I matched wrong button.
         They both laughed.
World's most luckiest Grandma ❤️
太好啦！

Oh my god why so much knowledge of everything...?!  How you know everything and others don't. You are so pleasing to my eyes I got addicted and watch all your videos.
Love from ❤
ماشاءالله تبارك الله شي جميل جدا ربي يوفقكي
Making a silk quilt from real silkworms: Is there anything this young woman can NOT do? Incredible and so Inspiring!
Waaaaww. Amazing dear ❤❤❤
M addicted to liziqi video's even though m purely vegetarian
The ultimate granddaughter.... :)
You didn’t show about the silkworm grows ! Thank you for that 🙏🏻
This is the life whic I am expecting to live....she s so active.. So talented....so amazing ...
الله يخليلك صحيحتك و يخليلك مك ان شاء الله يا رب
My very first time visiting her channel and IT'S FREAKIN' AMAZING!!!😀💜💜
阿彌陀佛……
从养蚕开始，到处理蚕丝，再一针一线亲手缝制，短短一个近7分钟的影片，这背后所花费的时间简直让人难以想象。
最后看着子柒捧着衣服被子开开心心的都拿给婆婆，那一幕真的把我感动得哭了。
Your are Soo talented,🌿
 like you cook, make so many things , even carpentry 
it's so relaxing to look your videos toooo✨
One of my favorite videos and channels to watch. 👏🏻 ❤️
太神奇了吧
I hear that studio Ghibli music 😂
Here's the translation:
(Note: The Li Ziqi community and her fans such as myself are still working on putting English subtitles on her videos. Please bear with us. Thank you for your understanding and patience).
In the meantime, I translated the description and translated some content from Ms. Li's Weibo.

"China is the very first country in the world to cultivate silkworms for their silk. Silk is an ancient oriental cultural impression. We have been raising silkworms since I was little. I see that winter is approaching, using this late autumn's double cocoons to make a quilt for my grandma for the winter." 

Ms. Li said on her Weibo account that she used double cocoons to make the quilt and clothing for her grandma. She didn't have enough double cocoons so she got some single cocoons from her neighbor. She also said they raise silkworms almost all year round. In the spring, summer, autumn and late autumn. Furthermore, the leaves she chopped up to feed the silkworms are mulberry leaves that she picked from the mulberry bush.
I like the way witch mske all so easy.before 45 year ago my mather do this.l live in cyprus
ชอบพี่คนนี้มากติดตามทุกคริป
Wow is there anything this woman can’t do? I’m very impressed. Makes me appreciate things more now that I have seen the amount of work needed. Amazing.
she's so talanted gifted with the knowledge she recieved from her grandparents i wish her grandparents to live for many more years to come. but the fact she made a planket out of the real silk is impressive if she was in a storm or some place she'd survive
这期把我看哭了😥子柒就这样一个人不慌不忙地把老祖宗的手艺一一展示给世界各地的我们欣赏 其中不乏非华语圈的朋友 与其说是纪录片 不如说是教育片 传播文化传播爱 谢谢！这是一项特别伟大的事业！多么希望子柒一直这么做下去。
OMG !! Incredible talent !
مرحبا انا معجبة بك كثيرا 
وارغب ان ازور الصين 
هل تستضيفينني ؟
I'm froms Indonesia 😍
I LOVE THIS VIDEO, IS INCREDIBLE! ♥️🌾
0:14 
grandma:”come and take a look.”
Ziqi:” are silkworms mature?”
grandma:” Yes, they are ready to spin silk.”
Ziqi:” Seems all silkworms are mature enough. They are ready to be collected.”
1:30 
grandma:”the silk cocoons are not as white as before.” 
Ziqi:” the color doesn’t matter, it’s all the same.”
Grandma:”we may not have enough silk cocoons.” 
Ziqi:” Then I will change for more.”
1:44 
Ziqi:” I want to change for bigger cocoons. I’m going to making silk quilt for my grandma.”
1:51 
Ziqi:” look Grandma, I got more silk cocoons.”
4:10 
grandma(touching the silk):” it will be so warm to wear.”
Ziqi(to cameraman):” Xiaodong, Can you help me with the silk?” 
Cameraman:” sure.” 
Ziqi:” And Minwei please also help.” 
4:24 
Ziqi:” grandma, pull it at that direction.”
Ziqi:” grandma, pull it at your direction.”
4:35 
Ziqi:”perfect!”
Ziqi:”let’s do it again, grandma you will go that direction.”
5:34 
Ziqi:” the quilt will be so warm to sleep in. Grandma, please go to bed early, I’m turning off the light for you.”
6:25 
Ziqi:” Grandma, getting up already?”
Grandma:”Yes!”
6:30 
Ziqi:” wait, before putting on your outwear, please try these on. If they fit well, I will wash them for you later.” 
Grandma(confused) :”Why I cannot do the buttons right.” 
Ziqi:” Hahaha, wrong line up. Let me help you with the buttons. Look, do it like this. hahaha” 
Grandma:” hahaha”
Liziki is just sweet lady.. I have watched most of Ur videos.. and I'm mesmerized... What a lovely place u live in.. The technics followed by the way u present it in the video r just  super fantabulous
أنتي فنانة بمعنه كلمة مشاء الله عليك 😘
都漂亮
很好
很好
mind boggling that in the age of high technology, one of humanity's greatest and most treasured inventions, Silk, is one of the most economically an environmentally sustainable products that is still being made today as it was thousands of years ago.

And the Princess Mononoke theme, is a nice touch :)
How did you learn ALL of these traditional skills?!? Especially so well. It's amazing that these traditions are carried on through you. Your videos are SO fascinating and beautiful
又看了一遍，想家了就看看，看着看着就哭了。
样样能，是个难得的女孩，天生漂亮，讨人喜欢，👍👍👍
It isn't show much of her sound but I can feel her happiness. And her make me feel peacefully is happy.

How can I spent hold day for watching this. It seems I am big fan for this first day.
I keep saying to myself... just one more video then I'm done.
For our wedding 27 years ago, my Chinese relatives gave us a silk comforter.  It is heavy, soft and made by hand. Its the most precious thing we received and it will last for many decades.
蠶寶寶。我以前超愛養。不知道還有沒有
WOW... THIS IS SERIOUSLY AMAZING!
紫のガウンドレス素晴らしいです。欲しいなぁ～
When I was in primary school around 1995, feeding silkworms is a must-do homework for every year-4 pupil in my city.
This is how humans should live with nature...as guardian and everything and everyone benefits.... I love this lady and her family.
It brings us the old memory when we don't have electricity. Thank you.
I love her grandmother
OMG OMG OMG 😱First time I'm seeing this from scratch. Superbly super 👌👌
A Life in heaven :-)
I'm just a teenager girl in Europa,who found your channel...
and after, every time i'm shocked. 
I swear, you are the most special, diligent, and gorgeous woman, i've ever seen. An exemplar. Your grandmother can be proud of you!
I think, I'm just your little european fan.
بجدا روعد ❤
اشياء جدا ممتازه 👍
This is amazing! 😊❤️👍🏼
I'm dying to know the background music in the beginning.. please help me!!!! T_T its fascinating!! HELP ME LIZIQI <3 love from Dubai
this girl can do so many things.
you are adorable😍
Making silk is all tough repetitive work, to extent of aching shoulder muscles.  Give praise to her morale and utmost effort.
Amazing work ! Time , effort , beautiful
is no one going to mention that the music in the background is from Mononoke hime?
Amazing, thank you for sharing.
She should give a speech about climate change instead of Greta Funnerberg
I had heard of this process before but had never seen it with such detail from start to finish. So amazing to watch!
I feel like she should be the matron Goddess for ADD/ADHD medicine and recovery or something, lol.
Поздравляю вы нашли русский комментарий))))
Is there any talent liziqi doesn't know...she masters all skills in the world.. Great 👌👌👌
The yellow fruits on the top were like bulbs 💡
不要笑我！
我從頭到尾是張大嘴巴看的，真是大開眼界，沒看過這麼多蠶繭，然後純手工製作蠶絲被！
只能說，李姑娘太厲害了！
Lý Tử Thất giỏi quá !!! ❤️
I'm so out of words .....just wooowwwww🌸
Heaven ❤️❤️❤️
That's so nice,u learn something new everyday! thanks
哪天打鐵做鍋子，燒陶做碗，砌牆蓋屋我都不意外了，中國古文化就這樣靠七分鐘視頻給傳揚開來了，真的很了不起
Do you know who are the two gentlemen helping stretching? At least I know one of them is the cameraman, Xiaogang. Ziqi asked Xiaogang to have the camera set up ready and come over to help at 4:09
All your videos are too good, I just can't stop myself from watching your videos . It's too beautiful. You are so hardworking. Your grandmother must be a kind soul that she got you as her grandchild. You have a pure 💓
You’re a wonderful young lady splendid video
Passion & patience, great gifts! 👍
媽媽問我為什麼跪在地上拜手機……･ω･`

Step 1 to make silk blanket:
She: Touch/hold/squeeze dead worms with bare hands
Me: *runs off
I never believed that it could exist, the true super woman. I am in love with all his videos, his culture in the countryside is the best of life in the midst of the traditions that they preserve.
If you've made it to this video just know that this is the best channel on YouTube.
Your really multitalented girl. I feel my self so shame. I could not do anything. How sweet your hardwork❤️❤️
I love  the music from "mononoke Hime" in the Background ❤
The biggest difference is that I did things for surviving, but she did things for living. Turn life into art. Amazing work. And I really admire her for taking good care of her grandma. Wish u all the best, Ms Li!
This lady amazes me when watching every video of her! Really, this lady is better than a thousand men and I don't relieve myself from these men😂😂😂
Oh yeahhhh.. I've found a very talented girl on youtube..
This is called empowered woman ♥️

Amazing. I'm gonna binge this whole channel, she's so skilled and talented.
Such a filial granddaughter 👏🏻👍🏼😘🥰
2.1k silkworms disliked this video...
人美心善，多才多艺，太腻害了
不过，为什么不等蝉蛹化蛾了再采棉呢？
（直接下锅略残忍的说）
I AM BANGADESHI GIR.I WANT TO LIVE WITH HER. IN HER SO BEAUTIFUL HOUSE.IS IT POSSIBLE.I LOVE HER VERY VERY MUCH.
🇫🇷❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Chị đẹp còn siêng năng nữa ❤ 😍😍
About Li ziqi, you should know: Her parents died when she was young ,so she grew up with the grand parents in coutry side. She had worked as a DJ in city for a few years,  then gave up her 
city life and went back to the hometown to take a good care of her grandma. Her grandma is the most important person in the world for her.
She is so multi talented 😍 ,envy her
പരുത്തി😊
Thank you so much for sharing this... It's so interesting..
Is it only me that the fist part of background music is a bit strange?  Well I watched this video before and it was like this...it should be the real sound of her moves
I was so depressed and low in my life over months for adversities had broken me. But, let me tell you honestly that your videos have given me a zest for life. Much grateful!
Damn, those pajamas look cozy
I thought the baby silkworms were black sesame seeds and when i saw them move i SCREAMED
This is incredible!!
奶奶健康长寿。。。
The real hard work and maybe this is how life was meant to be lived 🌑
How hard working you are..After watching you am shamed of myself.... 
Really amazing. God bless you dear....
You do your family proud, young lady... :)
我怕虫子 虽然它叫什么宝宝 但很可怕
I really respect you 😍
You can imagine how great the Silk Road was in ancient China.
这期让我触动好大，她到我回到了我9岁的时候，我们家养了很多春蚕，我每天的工作之一就是去采桑叶给这些小蚕虫吃，看着它们慢慢长大到结茧到破茧的全过程。很美好的回忆，虽在西雅图但看着她的视频感觉自己已经回到了9岁时老家的模样，谢谢！你真棒。
i have no comment! for this amazing video blog!
Li the way you love your grandmother is real pure love. 
She's so lucky to have you, and you to have her.
Thank you for this wonderful video, it is interesting, compelling, well-made, but above all, it is lovely.
Her grandmother is SO CUTE
I can't stop watching her channel. Addicted to her. She is so talented girl. 
Luv fr Malaysia.
Is there anything that you can't do? You know how to cook, sew, carpentry. You're a fine lady with so much talents 😍 i envy you. ☺
I had a silk blanket when I was a kid and lived in the Sichuan countryside with my mom, she made me the blanket exactly like how she did it.  I am so enjoying every single video she made and it recovers every detail of my childhood. In fact, those skills and lifestyles are slowly disappearing due to economic development in China; the desire of countryside people to move into the city became a norm.
Amazing video!💕👏👏👏 so perfect place👏
She learnt everything from her grandma and mother
The bestest..channel.. On you tube ever..👑
natures fibers truly are amazing. :)
She sure loves her grandmother!!
Okay YouTube, this IS the kind of video that should be in our Recommended list!
Not some s#!tty 15 mins click bait with ads here and there!
I wonder if for things like this she studied with a master first before filming, she has so much knowledge and so many skills
You are soo beautiful, I like you🥰
Wow that was so awesome. I am speechless. She can do anything!
Someone beyond amazing
她真的每分每秒都在忙，沒空生病，要保重啊。親愛的姑娘，帶領每位觀注她生活的人，揭開、走進中國千年生活與文化的智慧。
謝謝子柒，妳讓中國數千年來詩歌、文字、故事中的女子紡紗織布，活化在我們這末現代人眼前。
I believe in miracles while watching this .. my soul moves away to the moment where it happens I feel warm, satisfied and happy .. calmly touching the silk with my heart with the Mononoke theme in my mind all is perfect .. just as it was meant to be. my heart is complete. Now I can go. Farewell..
I love all your videos. Thank you, and please keep making them.
Prinçesa vç tem huma prática incrível pra lidar com tudo qui vç fais parabéns linda❤❤😎
Impressionante!
中國生活文化的偉大，能夠被這樣的被流傳下來，真的很感動，謝謝李子柒
전통적인 이불은 이렇게 만드는거였군요
멋진영상 잘봤습니다
傳統的被子是這樣製成的。 不錯的視頻
سبحان الله
Pengen banget hidup dikampung asri kayak liziqi😭😭😭
It must be great to wear or sleep in silk...its always pleasure to watch and learn....so thank you again for every thing I learned
I wish to have this shown on cable tv instead of teenage dramas. Our kids could learn a lot from her.
She such amazing.I admire her works..👍👍..She know everythings..Well done
多么唯美，子七代表了中国传统女性的优秀品质，娴熟， 贤惠，而又温文尔雅
If ths is real thn its real amazing
What else she knows?!! Very inspiring lady. Everytime she shows to us, 'what is life all about?!'. She in living in our imaginary life. Fairy Tale!
who dream to live a peaceful place like that? so Fresh not like cities
I can't describe the joy I feel while watching your videos.
It is am wonder to see what such a small creature like worm can produce such a strong and warm threads.
هي ستك دي مش ناويه تتكل على الله ؟ 😁😁
omg omg omg
you drive me crazy
Please type everything in English
Your video is very interesting, you are a hard working woman, I like your video, and your cute and innocent face
This is by far my favorite channel on YouTube
I will rather live this kind of life somewhere in the mountains than actually living in the city .
It'll be awesome if instead of learning nonsense in school i will learn to live life happily like this  .
Que hermosa mujer me encanta como aprovecha todos los recursos de la naturaleza y lo ingeniosa que es a parte de ser una excelente chef
Qui trabalho espetacular prinçesa n10 bjs linda❤❤😎
When i see her vidios
And iwas feel so good and calm the heart
好怀念！我奶奶以前就是养蚕人，那时候我们小孩子人手一件蚕丝的小马甲，现在想想真是好奢侈的童年啊！
She wear ,she eat, she sleep just from what she makes, so she is an active girl 🙃🙃🙃
es maravilloso lo que hases MEXICO
The most hard working
Cô ấy sống ở một nơi thật bình yên❤️, không ồn ào tấp nập như thành phố
Translation:
China is the first country in the world to invent silkworm silk and silk is also a symbol of ancient oriental culture. Since childhood, we have sericulture in our homes and we are about to go through the winter. We will take the double gong of this autumn silkworm to make a bed quilt for our grandma! !
Каждый раз пересматриваю это видио и каждый раз восхищаюсь её терпением. Сколько нужно труда чтоб сделать одно одеяло! Она большая молодец.
Wuauuuuu😱... No hay palabras para describir esto!! Es I-M-P-R-E-S-I-O-N-A-N-T-E🙌🏻😍
My love you have so much talent you are so talented and smart and I love you, honey are you ready to get married I’m waiting for you so we can be together once and for all I love you with all my heart I think about you all day and all night now🙏💕🌹🙏💕🌹🙏💕🌹🙏💕🌹🙏💕🌹🙏💕🌹🙏💕🌹❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
她还有什么不会的？太厉害了
RIP wormy. Your existence will forever live within the world's best fabric. :(
Maravilhoso!!!!
هل يوجد عربي هنا يخبط لايك
2:35 is it me or it's the same melody of the Mononoke Hime theme song?
我的天……小姐……你有什麼不懂做的？
There's something so serene and peaceful about her casually killing all those pupae with boiling water
I love it
Fantastic background music！
The scenery in these short docu films, is beyond incredible.
What's more impressive then the scenery? Is the amount of work this young woman does!
I give her props!💕💕💕💕
I love you from Nepal 🇳🇵 😉 😘
M new to watch these videos but now cant stop watching  just like addicted to ur videos  r excellent  awsome
This kind of vlog is what I want to watch unlike nowadays.. make up tutorial, trying hard comedy, pranks, bragging luxurious items, cussing and etc. This vid is like pure love, talent & amazingly calm.
Patients is most important  for this work. So long term work
真的很奇怪，每次看李子柒的视频都感觉她是红线女，聂隐娘跑来现代来了，有股子仙侠的味道！
Es increíble todo lo qué hace está mujer, ! felicidades!
Mashallah amazing
She must be in the top of the Guiness records with too many skills
Helooo lam from viettnam :)
Semua kebutuhan di buat sendiri mengambil bahan baku dari alam,rasanya mau pindah kesana saja,alamnya masih sempurna 😍
Amazing ❤❤
Tengo a mi Madre, que es mayor pero a la vez tiene ( Alzheimer), es bueno mirar al mundo y circunstancias con buen humor.
Why so many dislikes?? Just because she boiled the silk worms?? Why are people acting like saints nowadays when they do thing much worse. The worst sin is being ignorant. 
Stop using electronics, paper, clothes, food from supermarkets and taking baths. Then you can give this lovely lady a dislike... but since you are a saint, you shouldn’t have a smart phone nor internet so there should be no dislikes.
Wonderfull . ❤
I was so entranced by this video I didn't even notice the Princess Mononoke music in the background
It's a great image of peace in the mind. I take off my hat to you. Start a pleasant day.
ทั้งสวยทั้งเก่งนะค่ะ
She is so nice she really takes good care of her grandmother
This episode is from spring to late fall...
wow... u r a amazing person... 😍😘
You are an amazing girl in the world. I am very happy to see you.
That was really cool
This explaines why silks were expensive
This is the music from Princess Mononoko!
姐姐  借你的地方打个广告，想涨点关注！比心
Really very hard working girl she can do anything in this world
子柒姑娘，请问一下，有统计多少斤的蚕蛹出了多少斤的丝吗？刚好你的视频特别符合我的论文主题，想要引用一下，如果可以告知感激不尽！
This is so freaking awesome!  So glad this knowledge is being shared and not left to die with past generations. As an American i would never be able to see this and know the skills and traditions  if she didnt share it.... so thank you for letting us into your world and learn about your culture. It's amazing.
she's  amazing
Grandma is blessed!
好威啊！
your video touched my heart deeply
Mother, I want to marry her
the funny thing is, in Georgia in the us we have mulberries too. I always grew up playing with the funny looking worms that grew on them and never realized until middle school when we were taught about the silk road how connected to history i was ^-^
Aku selalu menyukai semuah videos yang kamu buat yang positif baik dan berguna dan bermotipasi untuk sodara2 semuah...
I LOVE YOU poki namah lah
She works hard. It takes a long period to make a video I  love you 💜💜💜💜💜💜
Liziqi eu ti amoo :)
_"I felt a great disturbance in the Force,_ 
_as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror_ 
_and then were suddenly silenced._
_I fear something terrible has happened."_
Who wants this girl as his wife.
Its so good to be true...you know all how to do all those stuff...i believe this is a rehearse...
Love you lizi ✨

When I see stuff like this. I always wonder who thought ages ago that if you follow this process you would end up with amazing silky fabric.
the sound track sounds like princess mononoke

You so soo sooo talented dear girl 😘😘😘😘😘

Im so thankful that i found this channel 💜💛
Amazing life. . she deserve it
Wow this is exactly what I'm making right now ...been experimenting for ages and so glad I found this ..!! Perfect as the cold comes in! Oh I'm not boiling worms though I just bought silk laps to make silk batting g because I had no idea where to find it and I'll prpbably use merino as well because its great too.
Omg amazing
连这个也会……到底还有什么不会啊。我以为会做那么多精致的菜，会做花茶和胭脂就已经是神仙了阿。
First time in my life.......am seeing how its made ........really she is awesome........hardworking.....👏👏👏
Aunt liziqi thanks for ur effort of teaching natural way of life...everyday  i learn lot from ur videos
Waw, waw liziki you are very good girl! You can explaine french. !

You make me realise that how lazy & useless I am 😧
U are amazing....it's incredible....it's unbelievable.....😳😳😳 I loved it....plsss upload these kind of videos to get to know about this.....👌👌👌👍👍👍
parabéns pelo seu magnifico trabalho bela obra de Arte
She has all the skills of life.She is so much so much detailed❤️
Wow she's amazing
I'm a carpenter in the u.s. . I've spent half my career doing handmade work , because nobody else here does it anymore . I carve , scroll saw , youkune veneer , and restore a lot of 100+ year old antiques . I love what I do .
Thank you for creating such beauty
What do they do with the leftover silk 'soup' of the larvae? Feed it to livestock? I kinda think so as so little seems to be wasted here.
Do I hear the theme from Princess Mononoke?
I love her Grandma
I feel like i'm missing out, at the end the video there is always advertising for another video blocking the seen when the video isn't over yet. Sure it's only for a few seconds but it takes away from the whole ending of the video. If you have contact with the video maker, and could ask them to put the advertising up after the video is over that would be much appreciated.  If anyone else feel this way please chime in thanks.
I am amazed at the skills of this woman.
She is making all impossible as possible ..!! Wow
This is how every grandparents should be treated 🙏
Man! I would love one of them blankets! I bet its unimaginable comfortable! Cause it's made with love!😇
子柒真的是猛到頂天了
從養蠶開始製作蠶絲被
太誇張👍
子柒太棒了
Wow is amazing and very differrent how to do silk from my  country Thailand. I love silk and I love your life your talent.
เธอคือผู้หญิงที่วิเศษมาก  FC Thailand

I admire ur knowledge very smart......
我尼玛……姐姐果然从养蚕开始的。。。还有谁不服😂
養蚕して絹を採り、それをそのまま布団にしたり衣服を作ったりするのってすごいですね。100%絹の布団ってどんな感触なんだろう。素晴らしい！
Oh....how I wish to be her grandmother.....🤓
Você é genial, sem palavras
最恐怖嘅係人類
以前是 哇 女神又漂亮又能干，我要娶她。
现在是 哇 女神又漂亮有能干， 我这个废材，配不上，配不上。
Amazing ⭐️
Only Rachel Khoo's can handle with her...💜💚
Soooo beautiful God bless you all amen
I accidently clicked one of your vids and now can't stop watching I'm obsessed!! So glad i found your channel.
真心觉得这么好的内容的视频可以增加长度 从自己开始养蚕到最后的蚕丝被做好 这么长的时间跨度 真心觉得这视频做到30分钟也不过分！我真的很喜欢也很愿意看更具体的内容！
Eles trabalham muito 💪💪mais é lindo tanta dedicação ☺️😊🥰ela tão maravilhosa tudo lindo comida 🥘 🏠 tudo
This woman is amazingly gifted, it‘s unbelievable!
世外桃源的女神
woah.. full of respect
我喺視頻裏面見到 子柒。 一個了不起的女孩子， 什麼事情都難不倒她， 天生一個能幹嘅人， 艱苦磨練起一個了不起個女孩子， 我形容佢一個真正女子漢， 子柒， 我祝福你永遠快樂幸福
70년대 시골에서 누에 키우는거 생각나게 하네
I visited a silk factory in China. She’s a Master!
I want to go on that villag... 
Just owo...😍😍
These videos are so calming. Then you remember the she is burning these silk worms alive but don't care.

Rip silk worms
2018-2018🙏🔥
When I feel sad or with no hope, I always come to this channel to restore my faith in humanity
Sangat mengesankan 😍😍😍 
I'm really like it's chanel 
It's my inspiration'
I tried keeping a small number of silkworms once and failed, they are voracious eaters I couldn't keep up with them and the rest of the stuff going on in my life at the time and yet she was able to look after so many and still farm and go about her very hard daily life she is amazing
Amazing 😍👏👏
I want to meet u really liziqi
A fascinating look at how you harvest silk.  There must be many like me who have never seen such a thing.  The process, the quilt, the vest, the maker.  Simply amazing!
Who knew a silk cocoon could stretch that far 😳....amazing video to watch...very soothing 😊
Hello from Memphis.  Thank You so much for the beautiful video.  Very good.
Çok başarılı bir YouTubersın videoların çok güzel 👏🌸
Every Clip...Big Quality.

very calming  and relaxing
I love her simple life, it just showed that we don't need as much as we say we do. I wish we could all have simple lives like this
So warm and fluffy!
Hóng tới bả tự đóng khung cửi dệt vải 😂😂😂😂

روعه.بمعنى.الكلمه.😘. متابعتك.من.العراق
THE UNKNOWN IS TEACHING YOU THAT YOU CAME INTO THE WORLD SO NATURALLY THAT YOU CAN SURVIVE IN THE SNOW NAKED THAT WHY OUR RESISTANCE IS PURE OF THE PUREST IN EXISTENCE!
我是香港人，在城市中生活的現代人，根本不知道蚕絲是如何製造，由養蚕開始到制被。子柒的影片，每一次都會我嘆為觀止，謝謝你！繼續加油💪🏻
An impressive women really smart and hard worker
Just one word Talented
ความสุขที่แท้จริง
At the end...
Liziqi : the worms you see on the floor are grown silk worms

Me : aww so sweet she made clothes for her granny,
😲😨 Wait... Did i just hear worms on floor...
That has got to be the most expensive duvet in the world, filled with silk 😳
That was brilliant
Oh,! Liziqui you're such a wonderful grand daughter
Watched September 2019

Lover her so much ^^

干活真麻利.谁能娶到她几辈子修来的福.
穿短袖采蚕叶，着冬装抽蚕丝，短短的视频要耗时一年去完成，就是真么爱子柒坚持的样子！
No he visto a nadie que haga las cosas que haces tu. Eres una bendición. 🕊👍👍👍
Как же я хочу такое одеяло! Как бы его купить?
もののけ姫
Боже! Неземная девушка! Дай Господь Вам здоровья, счастья, любящего и близкого по духу мужа! Вы самый драгоценный Алмаз!!!

all American girls should watch these videos   and if they do they will never watch the scummy kardashians again.
She loves her grandmother ❤️ so much.
Wow, this is incredible! She is truly capable of doing anything. All of her videos are so complex and aspiring, giving a glimpse into how her lifestyle is drastically different from most people's. I hope she continues to receive recognition and support from everyone who watches her videos.
Guao que creativa es liziqi, bueno si ese es su nombre 🇻🇪
She is most talented person in china.
I like her voice
Luar biasa...hiburan sambil belajar👍
比起做菜，我更喜欢看她做手工及设计，竹沙发，那个锅盖窑，那些秋千，还有梳妆台等，感觉很神奇，很厉害，很向往。
Я одна тут русская😂😅
もののけ姫〜
これは私たちの職業であり、私たちは東京からどんな平和が起こってもgiveめません。

宇内之闺阁中真乃历历有人,万不可因现今中国男人之不肖,又自护己短,一并使中华巾帼英雄泯灭也
All this hard work for a single comforter. This is dedication.
هاي نجار بنا طباخ خياط مزارع بتاع كلو
弱弱的问一句，煮的时候蚕就死了？
The song played t the beginning gave me a spooky vibe.. didn't think it fit well. the song played immediately after was so much nicer plus the audio from the video clips itself makes it nicer
Selimut ajja dri sutraa... Mantap... Multitalent...
Me: I’m bored. 
YouTube: Watch her make silk.
نولي نتخيل في روحي نملة توالها

从养蚕 到吐丝 到结茧 到抽丝 到制作成蚕丝被 天啊 这视频得拍了N久吧
i m getting frustaed coz she can make everything
Nice what's you made and appreciate your hard work
看到子柒的田野生活好羡慕突然好想去农村生活，，，
城市和农村一样有苦有甜看你对生活态度对生活的要求~
活对了方式农村生活一样也可以很精彩
孝行娘！
最後一幕，婆婆滿足的笑聲，好溫馨。
女神，連蠶絲成品都能從小蠶到成品，強。
the music is awesome in this video
So amazing!!
I love silk but I always feel bad for the silkworms getting boiled alive. I have a silk bathrobe from China and I like it but every time I try to wear it, it gets really really hot. I'm usually not able to keep it on very long.
もののけ姫だ！
What is this YouTube... Why didn't you recommend me before... I just discovered this Chanel now.. I m so amazed wondered  surprised..whatever.. No words.... is she human....!!!
Она просто великолепна 👍👍👍
이거 지브리 ost아닌가??? 완전 좋아함
♥️♥️🇸🇾
I'm so touched by this,  how so ?
这一个视频拍出来，周期好长，真的找不到这么用心的Up主了
Love u God bless you
Good ~~^^
Muchas gracias por el video, pena que no este en mi idioma,pero gracias.
The more one cannot have, the more one WANTS
This type of people are only few on Earth who love their grandfather and grandmother more than her 🙂🙂😔😔 love grandma and grandpa
Mononoke song suits the mood perfectly
You are beautiful ❤
李子柒 中国才女、把我们中华文化的魅力展现得淋漓尽致，是我们中国人的骄傲、是我们李氏家族的骄傲……
I never really thought about where silk came from but I definitely didn't expect that! 😱
真个真的是苦活累活。虽然视频很短，但是很多时候都要半夜起来进行喂食。
向千百年来辛勤的养蚕人致敬。
Wow ,I’m very happy to see your wonderful amazing work 😍😍😍😍😍😍
This is cruel! She cooked them a life! Watch a life cycle of a silkworm and you will know : (
Such passion!
Hi liziqi! I am making a quilted underjacket for winter maybe with pants too. I have silk laps to use for batting because I couldn't find silk batting here. So glad I found your channel because nobody is making anutjing like this where I am and its quite cold. I am bad at hand sewing but I really loved the clothes for hour grandmother and when I see what work you've done I have much less work to do so it will encourage me to take a little of your patience. Thank you so much.
I remmember my father who also grow silk worm.... sadly he past away already...  i miss him... hard work and dedication
I was in China and YouTube is banned, do how does she get all these beautiful videos uploaded.
Silk should be the main product in your shop
This is the true life. 
Stupid study and modern life took everything .
(Health,spirit and true love)
Phải giết mấy con tầm lúc trong kén à. =((
Sister you are versatile!!! You are a icon!!!!
請問有人知道煮繭加的白色粉末是什麼嗎？
A real princess 😍😍
BGM is Studio Ghibli Spirited Away.. fits so well here
is so incredible to see silk manufactured in an ancient way and not in a industrial one
I'm always repeating her videos
Credoooooo!!!! Cozinham os bichinhos vivos!!!!!?
Sao chị lại có thể tài giỏi đến như vậy chứ
我还曾想，你那么亲力亲为，会不会哪天做起蚕丝被。但又想想难道她是得从养蚕开始吗？那么花时间太不可能了……

没想到今天你真的把不可能变成了可能。而且你也把现代人摆在嘴上说的孝充分的执行了。
感动不是能简单说明的。
谢谢你，李子柒。认真的活出了一个自己想要的生活
Your so beutifu and talented
Maybe she has her own teacher/master 🤔
Who disliked this video? They must be evil people who have a  full of jealous in their heat.  Poor ones.
b nào giải thích hộ mình c ý mang một gùi kén đi đổi như nào
哦👍
Amazing 😍😍😍
Deve ser tão bom morar em um lugar assim , parece ser tão calmo
My God so talented
This is the silk road ,2000 years of history in China.
Молодец. Супер. 😍😘👍
Is there anything she can't do or make. 
Is it Ok if I take an apprenticeship under you.
Why did they changed the music ???
you really have to kill the puppa?
子柒雖然久久發一次影片,卻每一部都是嘔心瀝血的大製作!!..真是令人嘆為觀止...
一種等再久,都值得的感覺!!
she could literally do anything
❤️❤️❤️👍
Not sure how I found you but this was so interesting and so sweet XO, Kelly
Good job and good life 😍😍😍😍
第一次看到純手工把絲做成實物 ............... , 目前有539支蠶按了不喜歡
it makes me sad that they boil the worms alive. I wish they would let them hatch first and then boil the silk.
❤️ ❤️
Nuôi con tằm đúng là vất thật
Wow so very beautiful.🌹
古老得中国文化展现了她得无限魅力，就像酒一样，越陈越香。
Woo wooo esto es impresionate. Nunca imagine que esas bolsitas fueran eso.

好贤惠
Damn, I always thought people would just gather a bunch of silk worms and wait until it gets out of the cocoons not boil the hell out of it. 

EDIT : so it turns out, they ruin the silk and I heard there is one way to not kill them but idk if it’s true. Yay more knowledge ٩( ᐛ )و
Spectacular!
Why are we wearing polyester?
You are killing its 😭😭😭😪😪😪
That's so bad 😣😔😔😔

厲害
You are so hard-working .l am amazed to see you . you are the legend of China
đồ cho cả mùa đông bị chị gói gọn trong vòng chưa đầy 7 phút :((((
I remember my mom. With me nurtured silkworms. Made handloom silk clothe by extracting silkthread from d cocuns while watching this. My mother's memory coming again n again thanks from Manipur
我母亲在我小的时候也常养蚕，用蚕丝织绸缎，给我做衣服； 母亲还种棉花织棉布，做被子。还怀念小时候吃蚕蛹，拾棉花。My mother used to raise silkworms when I was young, weaving silks and satins for me to make clothes, and growing cotton and cotton for quilts. I also cherish the memory of eating silkworm chrysalis and picking up cotton when I was little.
I never see a girl like smart and kind
오오오 대단하네요
I am watching this video,and same time seating in front my window ,watching the mens destroying the forest.........I have fruit trees,cocuns from the worms and banana spider nest, a lot birds and some of them migrants and some live in my yard. But a wealth people deside to build a tank and gas pipes just across the street,were I have my fruit trees.   This lady is using wath jehovah give us to survive in a paradise. Genesis:1.     =26,27,28 .......she don't  kill but use the resources GOD GIVE US.  I am an old women and the wealty people don't care so they  deside to destroy  the environment and contaminate my fruits, harassing me. Jehovah protect all the families in the world ; efhesians =3,14,15 (to whom every family owes its name)
😲🤔впервые вижу этот процесс. Удивительно... 👍👏👏👏браво!
Wait you just boil the silk alive?!? Wow..the more ya know I guess
your videos are probably the only ones i don't watch on 2x speed
أنت رائعة أنا معجب بكي
蚕丝被真的很温暖，也真的贵。
Gods beautiful  gift is humanbeings life she says without any words
柒柒真的好孝顺
奶奶一定很开心吧～
All I can think about is the time I put a 100% silk blouse in the washing machine and ruined it.
Vải tơ tằm mà dùng để làm đệm thì đúng là phí
Aaaa........ Mazing
Это невироятно😍😍😍
I love  her so much  all of her videos are so peaceful  and she helps the family especially  her grandmother may she and her grandmother  live a long time

Presenting the hardest working woman on this planet, Li Ziqi! 

This kind of paying attention to detail in a step by step process that is all done by hand, which includes collecting massive amounts of mulberry leaves each day to feed the little silk caterpillers, is why raising silk has not become an industry in America. It takes so much work and resources to produce such a small amount of product. And you will never get paid well for all the work you put into it.
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻😍😍😍

Great 😍
李子柒我爱你
It's just so beautiful where she lives... No wonder she loves what she does and should be really gifted for what she knows and cherishes.
Is that the Princess Mononoke tune in the background?
原來蠶絲被是這樣做的啊 終於看到古老中國的文化 真感人 如有說錯話真抱歉

I literally cried watching this. In such a modern world, full of hustle and bustle, as we grow older life should be simpler. Maybe I need to live in China.
أنت رائعه
Simply wow.. Princess Liziqi
梦中女孩
Cô ấy làm youtobe giỏi nhất.
Nowadays in Vietnam,  rural people also use this way to produce  cloth. People said that Chinese people taught us in the past
You are so beautiful 😆😆😄😅
Anyone else notice the Princess Mononoke/Mononoke-Hime music? I wish I knew who did the arrange...
Your hair routine video pleaseee
She is awesome...
I'm glad that this video appeared on my recommendation☺

妳的頻視看了又看，百看不厭哦！小妹妹

我超喜欢看你的影片
从制作化妆品 （胭脂等等）到现在
It took How many days for Ziqi to make this 7 minutes video?
Sei forte 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Sao cô gái này có thể làm được. Giỏi quá. Vượt qua sức tôi nghĩ. Chúng tôi rất yêu quý cô.

🥰🤩🌺🌸🌺
Niceeyyyyy!!!

Background music name please. Anyone? X

Muhteşem birşey yırtılmıyor, gerebildiğin kadar ger, böceğin yaptığı şeye bak, ipek yorgan ilk kez gördüm, aynı yün gibi hatta elyaf gibi, elyafı bundan esinlenerek yapmışlar anlaşıldı, ama Türkiyede ipek böyle elyaf gibi kullanılmaz çok değerlidir pahalıdır. marifetli kız 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Waaaaaao
Девушка вы замужем?)
Just awesome....
بحبك 😍😍😍😍😘😘
看着流泪，你的身上看到了我的妈妈 奶奶 外婆，在你身上看到5000年中华文明的传承，犹如隔世看到了 我们的祖先伟大的女性辛勤劳作。
My God this woman does everything!👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻😱😱😱😱😱😱👍👍🏆🎉🎉
I have not seen such a strong lady
💖💖
parabéns vc é uma  guerreira criativa
This is so heartwarming, it touched my heart. The amount of skill and knowledge she has is just truly amazing. She puts so much dedication and motivation into her work and it's incredible. This is very inspiring to see This, as in city's you don't often see someone build their own furniture from the  complete beginning. The way she manages to take a simple feature from nature and turn into something so unique is a feature in this beautiful lady that needs to be recognised more.
I wish I'm wiht her
Amazing
Какая же молодец эта сексуальная китайская Слива!
BLESSINGS BLESSINGS BLESSINGS BLESSINGS BLESSINGS BLESSINGS BLESSINGS BLESSINGS BLESSINGS BLESSINGS BLESSINGS BLESSINGS BLESSINGS BLESSINGS BLESSINGS BLESSINGS BLESSINGS BLESSINGS BLESSINGS BLESSINGS  and many more BLESSINGS  ❤🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
I am wondering how she've learned all that ..Masha'a Allah..that's making me feel ashamed :(..hope her all the best❤
I feel useless 😑
اكثر من رائع
Просто Золушка!!!Молодец!!!
I love ur grandma
Your grandmother is very cute
😲🤓♥️♥️♥️
Боже,что она только не умеет
Nhà cái dell j cũng có
Люблю тебяяя💋💋💋💋
在这里感觉找到了中华文化的魂，有时看着唯美的画面会莫名感动😭
💚
Wonder woman
I would bet my last dollar, this beautiful and talented girl, attended college in the states. All of the furniture-making, arts & crafts, and fashion, are not talents handed down from generation to generation or, somehow, inherent in all Chinese farmer-women. Pleasant to watch, tho' and very informative.
Completely satisfying videos
The way she lives it was always my dream for my life, all though it's a similar, but this is something else, something by far much better. 
I have a feeling that she gives the greatest lessons of a life time (if not much more) and this is nothing else but : how to live our lives and what we really need to be just simple, just children of mother earth. She's an inspiration at  least. She can do anything with the very best way, mostly with natur materials. She looks after the earth and mother earth looks after her, and she proves it.  Is there anything better than this ?
do you boil the cacuns with the worms inside?!!! :(((
You showed us how the little cute silkworms became pure white silk, it's really amazing.
Hi .you are so talented...from Indian
Amazing
I just subscribed yesterday... but I'm already totally in love with China and its people like you and your grandma. Thank you from Mexico.

Beautiful
Wow...
It would take me a lifetime to learn half of everything she does so effortlessly. You never complain about the amount of work that your doing. Bravo. Every meal that you cook is done with patience and love.
大美，大赞 ！
love that background music of japanese animated movie  princess mononoke...😍🥰
chinese people can do anything
Extraordinary girl
This looks like a movie tbh
Today I will make a silk comforter. Oh, and I'll make jammies for my grandmother while I'm at it. No big deal...
Mais vous êtes célibataire ? ???????.NO🙁
No words.. just want to say woww
我是四川人，听着他们的乡音，身在异国他乡，不禁潸然泪下
Nice..Hard work
after I addicted to her videos I started to hated myself and people in my country That they used to experiment during Khmer rouge and after that they have such a harshest life but now they forgot everything and can't even hammer a nail or without even a screw drive in their home.
😍😘
impresionante
Can't believe my eyes ... That a human can live such a wonderful life... It's like I'm watching a movie😍
Girl u r very hard working
Very good girl to care of her old grand ma....so sweeet
Making sure grandma is warm and toasty.
Wow wow wow
你一个人顶的上十个孔子学院
Not everything handmade , eg the cloth she used for, but still appreciated her talent and patient
She is a superwoman
其實我覺得很殘忍，所以我從來都不碰含有蠶絲的東西…
Tôi yêu ban.rất tuyệt vời
你會紅並不是意外！真才實學！太讚嘆^_^
Helal olsun kız sana.
I don’t think I could do that. I wouldn’t be able to stop seeing the silkworms I raised. I know I’m a baby lol
she know how to make anything
A moment of silence for all the dead silk worms
Another master piece of art, simple, beautiful and warm.
Awesome 🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩
U dese naba

They boiled catapillers alive btw
I just can't believe you can do anything
And the butterfly? 😐
Oh wow...  What can i say?....

Super talented  girl love it 😊😊😄

I love how serene your videos are- it's like meditation for me. And the cinematography is astounding!

Anyone else feel a little bad for the worms?
Bravoo

I love how self efficient she and her family are. I admire their hard work, intelligence, and sustainability. It’s truly beautiful to watch!
I cant believe this life exist, maybe its only for show
I can't tell if she's really rich or really poor.
Those who jealous of her... They disliked her videos... What a great video
Amazing channel
She s soo talented 
She s making anything for home thing
Nhìn đã nhỉ?

Çok iyi 👏
Amei 😍😊
我觉得他们家就是一个生态循环系统。辣椒，葱姜蒜，白菜啥的都是自己种的，烂白菜叶子给鹅吃，死掉的蚕，生病的蚕给鸡，最后蚕蛹里烫死的蛾子可以用来沤肥。砍甘蔗留下的叶子给牛吃，做淀粉剩下的红薯给猪吃。我超喜欢这样的。。。
This lady is unstoppable
R u kidding me 🙄🤔🤔
😘
I didn't like the way silkworms were killed 😧....that was brutal... Being dumped in boiling water😢
子柒居然还会养蚕
子柒是超人
جميل جدا
不知不覺就連續看了好幾小時子柒的影片,太讚了!
The love and respect she has for her nan is awesome. Being taught from a young age to do what she knows how to do today.
Ohhhhh Grandmother was out helping with you. I love seeing her with you. You can just see the love & respect you have for each other.
And you did all this for her is the most ULTIMATE LOVE. You are a very good person, inside and out.
Anyone else notice the flute music sounded a lot like the Mononoke Hime theme?
Everything is so natural, I love it.
Precious and sweet. I love how you care for your family.
I wish everyone could appreciate what they have!
Love her love of family❤️
I love that you take such care of your grandma!
Thanks for making me realize that I have hands and led that has to v used
หลงรักผู้หญิงคนนี้💕
You are a truly amazing lady, I can't believe how talented you are, more videos please x
Oh my god.. Im so happy watching this video!

Lizqui you make us all astonished!! All you make is stunning!! Love you and admire your force and determination!!🌷😘

我不知道你在视频中展示了很多东西，我喜欢它们 ☺️💛
Your channel is so beautiful and peaceful. 🍃I subscribed!😊❤
At the beginning I thought she would weave silk cloth using traditional Chinese weaving machines and then make clothes out of it. That would be a lot harder than making quilts and quilted jackets and pants.
Maşallah, ne hamarat hanım...
Im crying cuz all things are so beautiful
Im so happy to see this video.. its like a documentary.. the mountains, plants and trees.. with ancient tools and household tools.. the waynof their living.. the way everything is produce (no need to explain by words) just by watching.. its more like a documentary or natgeo.. everything is beautiful esp the lady.. i will never be tired of watching this
Very Peaceful. 
Beautiful Cloak.

At first I thought she would cook the silk worm and eat but wow, incredible.😀😁
Foot I can only dream of sleeping in silk sheets
Wow. So satisfying video... the love between you and your grandma is awesome..
So sweet grand child 😊😍

May i stay with your family there for just a week? I've learned so many knowledge and skills from yr channel
I always knew that the worms inside the cocoon had to die cuz my mom and grandma used to do exactly the same thing and told me the process but watching this had shattered my denial that no silk worms are harmed 😥
Did she really just boil them alive
❤❤❤❤❤🌷🌷🌷
Whoa! Boiled the worms to kill them in their cocoon... 😲

I love how she cares for the old lady,  and the way that old lady smiles. Bless them
I see how the silk is being used as batting in the blanket, but how did you get it into sheets for the outside & pajamas?
Hiếu hảo
子柒呀子柒，你也文也武，宜動宜靜，又有孝心，作為中國人很感powerful!

Li ziqi is a very honorable woman. I look up to her almost as a role model. She is kind, smart, hardworking, and loving to her grandmother. Her videos always make me smile.
She is one of the most amazing women I've ever seen - tough and super capable (of doing ANYTHING!) and also so SO sweet to her family especially to her grandma! Much love and Respect for her!!  🙏💓💖💓💖
Вот это я понимаю  съемка , Рукодельница не в сказке сказать не пером описать - волшебно все !

La sericultura es una labor muy importante para la industria textil y la fabricación de artesanías en general.  💯
Translation: Sericulture is a very important task for the textile industry and the manufacture of handicrafts in general.
Even you made clothes. Oh my God. You should to be president 🤣🤣🤣
And to think there are people out there who work really hard while my lazy ass is eating chilli...smh
I've read about silk making but this is the first time I've seen anything about it. Informative and a lot of hard work.  Enjoy your videos and have a good day.
Wow!  What a miracle of God.  Littlw worms make such strong cloth.  I thpught she'd sell it in the market.. Does she know how xpensive it can be? Such hard work but worth it.
is this why silk is so expensive? i don't think this could be mass produced legitimately
I like how there are directions when everyone watching will not be able to make it.
جيت من عند فطوم 😂😂
Watching her channel is literally spiritual for me
我看别的视频的时候就很垂涎欲滴你们家的柚子了
Who are here to enjoy the beauty and sounds of nature
I actually just made this at home! Had to use two pomelos, and it took an awful lot of time to thicken, but it turned out to be great! I will put it on pancakes :D Thank you for the recipe!

成長刺青春秋冬瓜果實的是要有的話汽車國家級R你是這次智齒就會經濟及給上個世紀的只有你是這次智齒就
One thing about watching her videos is that I got the knowledge of using the fruits peel, which I throw all away to the rubbish bin almost every morning when I do the fruit juice, that make me feeling guilty.


Wait...does she use a stone wok to cook the fruit? Is that common in China? The very heavy wok for sure.
My days are not complete without watching her videos.....m like obsessed with your videos like everything u do is just awesome n real 😍😘keep on doing this...❤

มองเห็นชาวจีน ก็มองเห็นผีที่ออกมาจากศาลเจ้าจีนที่ไปรังแกผู้อื่นอยู่ทั่วโลก บีบบังคับผู้อื่นให้มาตอบสนองความอยากของตน..เช่นการค้าขาย

Wow! Where I'm from in the Caribbean, we call that fruit Shaddock. I was so surprised to see you have it there as well. And it's the first time I've seen it used like this. Great stuff! Where I'm from we normally just peel and eat the inside.

這些技能不是set好的就是真的從小愛學習細節才能辦到，對她來說是常識對我們來說長見識，也許就如她說的是她生活的手段但是不愛學習的可能沒辦法同時擁有這樣多技能，有能力真的比只有錢還重要，沒品味還真學不來

讓生命更有意義，請思考過這個終極真理：造物主（安拉）創造宇宙萬物；而人卻製造出許多“神”！The Creator (Allah) creates everything , but man makes so-called "gods"!
It's a fruit, great for dieting
Sencillamente maravillosa y la música bastante relajante.

我只是想說我昨天發現了你的視頻而且我很快就愛上了。美學是令人驚嘆的，而且體驗非常安靜。我非常愛他們，希望你能繼續長時間製作它們。

I am using Google Translate, so I'm sorry if this doesn't make much sense.

I just wanted to say that I discovered your videos yesterday and I'm instantly in love. The aesthetics are just amazing, and the experience is so peaceful. I love them so much and hope you continue to make them for a long time.
Có ai Vietnam's ở đây không😘
That had got to be the world’s largest citrus fruit ever! I can only guess at how sweet and tart the tea must taste!

Rồi ăn kiểu sao mn?
Wow I'm from Germany and I watch  your videos too. I like them.
she knows everythings
your beautiful...
千と千尋だ😌😌
Watching these videos, I just think about how I’d need a full recipe book, full ikea-like instructions, a farmers handbook, a step by step needle work diy, I mean she’s doing this from memory. It’s honestly so impressive. If anything for her is muscle memory. I’m two years younger than her, and feel so incompetent. I wish I was handed down skills like these from family. She’s so lucky.
Wow that is one huge pomelo! That’s my favourite fruit!
Vãi người dịch 😂😂😂😂
Aah the music 😊😊☺️☺️☺️☺️
Giản dị xinh đẹp yêu quý idool

How did someone thumbs down?
Youtube recommended me this video for days, finally decided to watch and realize that i have this fruit on my backyard.
Going to try later.
She looked into the camera like ‘hi yall ya ready to see me pick this huge fruit’
Its calming to watch her prepare those beautiful meals and the plating is 5 star. 🍾🥂Its like a beautiful dance
She prepares a massive amount of food. Surely her and her mom don't eat that much. She must reside in the garden of Eden because there is no place on earth that  provides so many different variety of beautiful fruits and vegetables on their property that ripen just in time.. Who takes care of her gardening? It is immense! 
Great choreography
Backsound music? Plis
I recognize the studio Ghibli song
The delicate composition of these videos makes my heart feel so calm and relaxed. A contentment I only seem to find through Asian cultures though...
Ad dịch nốt đi ạ. Đến đoạn mấu chốt lại thôi
Best channel i ever see 😊😍😘

Try this fruit's ripe pulp with salt, mustard oil, coriander leaves, and green fresh chillies.. Mash them a little  n enjoy

Pomelo is a very common fruit in southern China. Some of them taste sour, some sweet and some bitter. It's very a natural vitamin source and the trees are so easy to grow. Their thick skin also absorbs smells. Put the skin in your room after eating the fruit. It keeps the room nice and fresh:)))
刀功真厲害🖒
مبدعة وراقية
Itu buah apa ya??

this video gives me idea. or else I throw sour pomelo.
I've spent my more than half-century life always wanting simply nice, gentle, non-dramatic, pleasant, enjoyable things like this to watch. I had given up & thought nothing like this existed. But now I have finally found my dream, completely.
nice foot!
这柚子真好～个头大，水份足～

Gosto muito de ver seus vídeos😍

SO I have been told a ripe pomelo is more flat on the top and bottom. Does that mean this is an under ripe one?

So then you put spoonfuls of the mixture into hot water to make tea? Forgive my western ignorance. I just want to do it the right way.
Watching this after 2019 videos were like before and after photos, from her looks to video productions, it has changed and progressed so much. Can't wait to watch more! Love from the Philippines ♡

Многие грейпфруты, которые вылизывали в течение долгого времени, наконец-то добрались до свежего медового помело + меда, взятого из собственного улья, а цвет - янтарный, мякоть кристально чистая, что является идеальным медово-цитроновым чаем! ! ! (Кожура помело: мякоть = 1: 8, чем более чистые и горькие белки в кожуре, тем менее горькие)
😮
Я очень сильно люблю помело!
Kya hai ??
All of this is professionally filmed staged and edited.... just because it's another culture doesnt mean it's any more authentic than a staged tv show in America.  It's for views, plain and simple.  Theirs a production company on the other side of the camera and shes hired and scripted.
Yes

这是什么样的女人？
There’s lot of snow in the winter videos, how do these citrus trees survive???, or do they have two homes in different regions? I’m a orchard hobbyist so couldn’t help being curios, love her channel my absolute favorite!!
我是日本人🇯🇵。我正在使用翻译功能。我看了很多关于这个人的视频。看到这个人的视频和这个人自己的美丽世界观是非常愉快的。在中国，这个人养的电影，家庭和生活是常见的烹饪吗？我渴望这一生。我今年18岁，但我希望像这个人一样过更接近大自然的生活。从现在开始，我期待着美丽的外表，生活和烹饪的视频！请尽力！♡


我很惊讶很多回复。谢谢。回复太多，我很快就看不到回复，因为我使用翻译应用程序。我想我有时间会读它。如果SNS被滥用会有很多危险，但SNS的一个优势是你有机会触及这样的其他文化！
What a waste of fresh delicious pomelo!
We cld it ROBAB TENGA in our local language
Hello Lizi qi
Nice cooking  I loved very very much  Thank you so much Liziqi  .

ziqi注意音乐版权哦，如果已经有了请忽略我的留言。加油加油！祝婆婆身体健康。
These videos are beautifully shot and quite informative. The titles for each is perhaps one of the best parts.
しかし毎回関心する、作れるものは自分で作ってしまうのだから。私は、大概お店で購入してしまう。！Σ(￣□￣;)
I'm so blessed to have found your channel. You are amazing!
Ai sub tiếng việt vậy.? ::)
i love pomelo.. iYou are lucky to have a pomelo vineyard.. so exciting to see them in your own garden..
ชอบมากคะ อยากให้มีซับไทยบ้างคะ
This is her early videos that she recorded by herself i think if you look at the difference between her vids now. Good jobb lizi qi, from the bottom now you are on the top!
It looks jam or marmelade. I want to eat bread with it!!!

Thanks!!!
這是我會完整看完的視頻
How do they control the temperature of the oven or stove by fire?
You know it's about to go down when she breaks out that rock sugar.
Mouthwatering OMG my Favorite Citrus 😋😋
I am Vietnamese.  I would love to watch your video.  Admire your will to rise.  Good luck
Your music is so nice and you are so beautiful and your recipes  is so good 👏

I love u so much liziqi,you have brought so much peace and happiness to my soul, I can't explain by words, you are a true angel, there are people who have started to copy you and your channel, but don't worry about that, always remember you are The original liziqi, The original beautiful and hard working, lovely mountain girl, and always will be, you are a star and always will be for your simplicity, and beauty....... they are copycats, don't let them ruin your peace of mind and your beautiful life.... God bless you girl!!!

How is that meant to be eaten? By the spoonful, or do you put it on bread or crackers, like you would with preserves?
Você oferece muita paz através do seus vídeos curto todos ❤👏👏👏👏👏👏 amo a China é um lugar lindo 😍

We used to eat this fruit raw instead of making tea, it was a good idea, as in kerala South India many houses have this tree, it's in white, red and pink colour too.
Chị đẹp qúa
I love her cooking  stayl  and her garden
Çok severim ama çok pahalı bir meyve
Uma mulher dessa vai viver mais de 100 anos so comida natural
คนไทยหายไปไหน
So the only ingredients are Pomelo Pulp, the peel and honey. Am I right?
我喜欢子柒的世外桃源生活。顺便来蹭一下热度。欢迎喜欢钢琴的小白来我的频道学钢琴喔。

Can't stop watching her videos
Liziqi, Omithofo
I'm not familiar with pomelos... there's a lot of fruits and vegetables in China that I've never seen. It looks like a humongous grapefruit when you're peeling... Liziqi is so beautiful that I don't pay attention to the details like I should...lol! Her beauty just mesmerizes me! An angel, with so many skills and her cooking is absolutely amazing and phenomenal... I'm sure the tea is awesome as she is!!!💞💞💞👏👏👏👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻💯💯💯💓💓💓

From India 🇮🇳
素敵な映像ですねぇ。。。ほのぼのします。　日本人で、これだけの料理？？出来る人が果たしているのか。。。素晴らしい日常ですね。珍しい動画を有り難うございます。
まだまだ続けて見させて頂きます。
柚子這麼大顆啊∑(ﾟДﾟ)
Lovely
Are u snowbaby? 🙄
Is nobody going to talk about her just sticking her hand into that bee hive and taking their honey 

The bees are like nahhh she can have it she’s nice and plants flowers for us so we Gucci
So I read an article about her, her parents divorced when she was very young, then she went to live with her grandparents in the rural area. When she grow up, she tried various job at the city.. once upon a time, she got a call that her grandma was sick so she left everything and cameback to hometown to take care of her nana. She was inspired by her brother who uploads singing videos on Meipai (Chinese social media) and thinking that she could do one of that too. Over the years through trials and errors she was able to build her channel.
After learning this about her, I was really impressed. All i can say is, she is truly a hard working person and never leaves her family. We all should be inspired!!

Ps: All that woodworking and cooking skill she learned from her grandpa. Apart from this channel, I heard that she is also a bussineess woman 😍
Girl, drop that hair and skin care routine.
Definition of a girl that dont need no man. She is literally other worldly.
*Grandma must be 200 years old eating food 1000% natural* 👏





Edited: Thank you for the likes everyone, I've never thought this comment would reach so many hearts😂
it seems I'm in love
Greetings from France,
Big kissings to Grandma,

Princess in the forest
The sun behind the trees
A queen in a happy hive
And from the green ground
A couple of Ginseng awake
The moon shines in our eyes
And dreams flow in the train
Lovely honey with a smile
I am happy to see you grandma

Blessings
PatH.
This is pure peace to me. Thank You Liziqi. Something I could never obtain in my life, I may experience and live vicariously through You. I have found peace.
4:09 Living in a countryside but there are no bugs at night... This just seems rather bizarre to me.

Netflix needs to hook you up on your own series
Really I loved what you do 
You are amazing
*No idea why this video was in my recommendations but boy OH BOY am I glad I found this channel*
我喜欢这样的生活没什么压力
こういう所で、こんな女性とゆったりした人生を送りたいなぁ。

Best 5mins spent on YouTube at university of liziqi❤️
The roots she was digging the soil to get looks like those screaming plants things from Harry Potter
I'm from Vietnam with love 🥰😘
Beutifull, smart and strong 😍😘
My mom was a farmer too. I showed her this and she said *You are being surprised seeing this but I'm not. I've done all of this in my younger days. Being a farmer is both hard and challenging but we always found happiness and enjoyment.*

I feel so happy and proud after this. I know I can't be like them but I'll make my mom proud in my own way.
The women we want. but can only admire through a screen.
Look at her finger at 4:35. She is really hardworking.

In another life time i wish this had been my life. Living in nyc might have rendered my consciousness about real life. I envy hers, it seems absolutely beautiful and simple
can't understand where the dislike come from...  this girl is amazing！！！
🥰that was so cute "ginseng is bitter i am sweet".🥰
Essa moça e tao linda e delicada e faz cada trabalho pesado e continua tao delicada, parabéns
Beautiful and smart girl!God blesh you!
This short one is an ad movie selling the honey ginseng in her name at the end of the movie. the Ginseng was from far far away in northeast  China bordering Korea and her home village was in southwest China in Sichuan Province.
You teach me an old woman that life is worth living, your value is beyond riches of gold and silver.  May you be always treated with the highest respect, love, provision and health x from cotswolds uk
Thanks for show your live! From Argentina i send a big hug! God bless you.
So beautiful and so fres

Hello, I really like your video, can you upload the video again when the brightness of the video is added a little😊❣️
晚上好 每个视频都很棒 不要惊叹我的语言的弱点，我是埃及人，不会说中文，我会尽一切努力向您表达自己的声音 我确定我是任何自然人，思想简单，不希望过着平常的生活，唯有美丽的انسانه思想和她的小天使般的脸庞，才能拥有美丽而简单的生活。 向您致以问候，并祝您早日表达我的钦佩和爱意
这广告拍的真好
Whether the video was choreographed or not, I don’t really care.  I really enjoy seeing the traditional ways to live.  We talk about modernization as if we are better than the old folks, yet I wish I could go back to living the old ways.  Much more sane and healthier than the fast paced electronic age.  What a work out just to prepare a meal.  No hitting the gym afterwards.  It makes much more sense to me.  As for the doubters’ comments and dislikes, it only reflects the hate inside the commenters, not the young lady who made these videos possible.  Thank you for making my day better by showing the beauty of the old ways.  Many blessings and keep making these beautiful videos 👍
" Bà ơi, cháu về rồi!" nghe thật là ấm áp, nếu sau này ng bà mất chắc cô ấy sẽ buồn lắm😣

She makes me miss spending time with my grandmother... I miss her a lot. Its good to see young people loving their elders.. Family is everything.
I always loved her videos. The cinematography is lit tho. I wonder who is taking the video.
😘2:12偷親一下 看著妳 我人生也甜了
对，你是最甜的！
i grew up in here，when i was a child ,whenever i take a train,i could always see another train filled with logs beening shifted to southern parts of China，now there's not much trees left to  make a vedio like this in our province，I really hate them for doing it
This girl lives in my dream life. Simple, peaceful, and surrounded by nature.
"After 29 procedures, the richness and sweetness of its fragrance becomes stronger." What procedures are being talked about?  Heating ginseng honey?
ولك كفوووو والله ياعمي انتو اهل الصين مين قدكون

子柒：“你们这个蜜蜂一般会蛰人吗？” Ziqi:“are the bees aggressive towards people?” 
阿姨：“一般情况下不会的” 
woman:“they are friendly in general.”
2:08
子柒：“你等下也让我也试一下好不好.”
Ziqi:” can I have a try by myself?”

Ziqi:”mmm, pretty good, tastes different from our local honey.”

“来，婆婆，你喝这个，等下，先给你剥个栗子（水栗）”
“Have this drink, grandma. Take this water chestnut as well”

Grandma:” tastes a little bit ...(I lost here)”
Wow she's such a badass young lady.  May you continue to have success with your videos. I love them all.

You are just an amazing girl,i saw ever in my life ,,,, take care of you and your grandma 🌺💞💞💞

I should be studying my medical terminology flash cards right now, but here I am. Watching someone be productive, while I procrastinate
Splendid video. When I saw u taking the honey without protective wear I was like.... Aaaaahhhh!!!!!! When u feed grandma some honey I was like..... Aaaawwww!!!!! And the part where u ate some honey comb I was like..... Ooooo!!!!!!! Those were the highlights for me. Lol
For some reason I wasn't expecting her to crush the honey comb with her hands.
Sup indonya doongg😢
صينية البنت افتكرتها  يابانية ❤️❤️
以往看影片时只能在屏幕后流口水，而未来有机会可以买到了，其实我是非常非常开心和期待的。
对于商业化，各人褒贬不一，这是肯定的。但是那些因为商业化而觉得“梦想破灭”的，难道你真的以为人家是仙女，吃风就能饱？她也是人，还有一个奶奶要照顾，有谁会不想让自己的亲人能过上更好的生活？将心比心吧。
Plant the seeds after cold striation in sand and it takes at least 5 years to get large root .
its amazing how gentle she dug that ginseng out, i'd have unknowingly rip that shit outta ground lol
2:10 你是如此美丽，蜜蜂不咬人
영화 같다 그냥 좋아...
If her grandmother eat these all natural healthy foods probably she can live for the next decade as well. LOL
喜欢这种拍法，上一秒在长白山挖参，取蜜，下一秒就回到奶奶身边，很玄幻，很仙侠的拍法。👍👍👍
Oh the honey is yummy 😍

Fun fact: a long time ago, Ginseng was one of the most expensive products in the world.  It was believed that ginseng had healing properties and was called the "human root" since it sometimes appears to be in a humanoid shape.  The more human-like the root, the more potent the healing.  One root could cost as much as a peasant would make in their lifetime.

Chinese translated to English : Changbai Mountain ginseng honey, to give life a little sweet. The ginseng honey from Changbai Mountain is made with 4~5 years of ginseng cultivation and an average of 70 years old eucalyptus nectar. After 29 procedures, the sweetness and scent will appear rich, mild and not easy to get angry. You can eat all year round and give your life some sweetness.

I imagine all the jealousy and hate she must receive in china. when anyone displays even just a little godliness, people all of the sudden feel entitled to her skills not knowing how much a person suffered to be a certain way today. bless her
I can see Heaven and Angel...
Could you use the technique using ginger?
I await your comments, thank you!
Amazing as always
Nasıl güzel şeyler yapıyorsun sen😍👌
This is better than a chinese series to watch..😊😊 i want to live like her.. so peaceful to live like that.. hopefully i can do like she did...
Are those euro bees? Huh, didn’t know they also were in China but I guess that’s to be expected from most keepers
Xem mà nhớ lại cái thời mình còn ở trung quốc quá
I want to stay in the city for one,two or three days or months. but spend to want my hole life like this place. Totally pure nd peace
It's like watching a living fairy tale. So beautiful.

I love that she takes care of her grandma.

I love it when she’s serving grandma a taste of honey. She puts her hand under the spoon to avoid dripping. The same hand that was IN the honey, and is cascading honey... 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I do bee keeping... but never had the guts to do it without a protective gear....  BUT SHE!!!

Damn, I wanted to stick my hand in a beehive so bad!
Love you from 🇲🇦
大拇指应该是被重物砸到了
I love you so much ❤️
What else you left to know ,LIZIQI has magic hands that's all I can say about her God bless her for long live.
我打開視屏， 看到一幕 真係好窩心嘅場面，子柒， 沿途帶我哋去森林裏面睇到好靚嘅風景， 我好驚奇睇到新聞裏面有人參， 佢小心翼翼咁帶 家裏， 還有帶啲蜜糖 給他奶奶品嚐， 她 真係好 孝心， 我嘅記憶子柒， 是一個真正 孝順的好孩子

믿기 힘든게 양봉 장비 없이 꿀을 따요!?? 벌이 안 쏘나요!???
정말 신기함
It was scary when she went close to the bee hive , as I have seen people  are all geared up. OMG  good nothing happened. She is so hard working and does a lot .  I just keep wondering  how  do they manage  the entire place it is so huge acres of land different  things  grown in patches . Some say it is government land some say it is hers . What ever she is good and all the hard effort.

在YouTube遇見中國不容易啊。偶然遇見你的視頻我感覺到了中國的大自然。想起來小時候那段在山中玩耍的時光。
I love you from Nepal 🇳🇵😉
Damn..it seems like she is excavating some very valuable terracotta artefacts 😱😱😱😱😱

Tbh in the thumbnail i thought she was just  making pancakes in a really weird oven but apparently it was honey
Can your grand mother adopt me please?! I would love to be your sister ❤️
She's so pretty taking care of her grandmother :)
人参性热吃多了上火。把参泡在蜜里，让人参融合椴树蜜，既保留人参的天然活性，又相辅综合人参的热性，减少对人体负担。四季皆宜，达到人参和蜂蜜的双重营养。仔细看视频，蒸的时候拌的蜂蜜是不吃的，仅用来蒸制脱水。蒸好后人参片挑出来用新鲜椴树蜜浸泡。大家自己做的时候也要注意！最近品牌要上线要涉及到品宣，所以产品都会有视频。拍视频的时间零零散散！怎么辛苦就懒得说了，如果觉得有打扰的话麻烦取关一整子哦！——以上来自子柒微博，请大家和善评论，互相理解谢谢~

Почему я это смотрю?
Một truyền thuyết của Trung Hoa, nhân sâm phải đào bằng mộc đào buộc vải đỏ, nếu ko linh hồn của nó tinh nghịch sẽ chạy mất giống như trẻ con. :v :v
( Nhờ 5000 bạn FB, bạn nào thạo tiếng Hoa dịch ra tiếng Hoa đăng lên các Forum cho người TQ đọc để họ hiểu rõ hơn ).

Thư ngỏ

Kính gửi :.
- Bộ Ngoại giao nước Cộng hoà nhân dân Trung Hoa.
- Đồng kính gửi anh Cảnh Sảng phát ngôn nhân Bộ ngoại giao Trung Quốc.
- Chị Lê Hằng phát ngôn nhân Bộ ngoại giao Việt Nam ( cứ theo các luận đề này mà phát biểu cho dư luận trong nước và quốc tế hiểu rõ ).

MẤY LUẬN ĐỀ VỀ TRẬN HẢI CHIẾN HOÀNG SA NĂM 1974:

1. Trận hải chiến ở quần đảo Hoàng Sa nổ ra vào ngày 19 tháng 01 năm 1974 là một sự kiện lịch sử có thật. Vì vậy, bất kỳ ai, dù là người Việt Nam, người Trung Quốc hay người nước nào cũng phải thừa nhận sự thật lịch sử đó.

2. Trận hải chiến đó có hai bên đánh nhau. Bên tấn công, xâm lược là Trung Quốc. Bên chiến đấu phòng vệ là lực lượng Hải quân của Quân đội Sài Gòn.

3. Xét theo mọi tiêu chí thì quân Trung Quốc là quân xâm lược, phi nghĩa. Còn Hải quân Sài Gòn canh giữ Hoàng Sa là đối tượng bị tấn công, bị xâm lược, do đó cuộc chiến đấu của họ thuộc về phía chính nghĩa.

4. Xét theo luật pháp quốc tế, việc Trung Quốc giành được Hoàng Sa bằng hình thức cưỡng chiếm là phi pháp, cho nên chủ quyền mà Trung Quốc xác lập được trên quần đảo này từ năm 1974 đến nay là vô giá trị và không được quốc tế thừa nhận.

5. Việc Hải quân Sài Gòn vì bất cứ lý do gì mà đã bị đánh bại, bị thất trận và để Hoàng Sa rơi vào tay Trung Quốc thì phải được ghi nhận trong lịch sử Việt Nam là TỘI, chứ không phải là CÔNG. Tội này cũng giống tội của An Dương Vương làm mất thành Cổ Loa để nước Âu Lạc mất về tay nhà Triệu, nhà Hồ thua trận để nước Đại Việt mất về tay nhà Minh, nhà Nguyễn thua trận để nước VN  rơi vào tay Pháp.

6. Cái chết của các binh sĩ Sài Gòn trong trận chiến đó cần được ghi nhận như bằng chứng về việc quân Trung Quốc xâm lược cưỡng chiếm quần đảo Hoàng Sa của Việt Nam.

7. Cuối cùng, cần khẳng định rằng Trung Quốc không có cơ sở lịch sử và cơ sở công pháp quốc tế để biện giải cho cái gọi là "chủ quyền" của họ đối với Hoàng Sa. Trong khi đó, Việt Nam có  đầy đủ bằng chứng lịch sử từ thế kỷ 3 TCN đến nay và có đủ căn cứ pháp lý quốc tế về chủ quyền quốc gia của Việt Nam đối với quần đảo này./.

 亲爱的：
 -中华人民共和国外交部
 亲爱的中国外交部发言人Canh Sang先生。
 -越南外交部发言人Le Hang女士（根据这些主题，她将在国内外征求公众意见，以供理解）。

 有关1974年海青战役SA的这些补贴：

 1. 1974年1月19日在西沙群岛发生的海战是一个真实的历史事件。 因此，任何人，无论是越南人，中国人还是任何其他国家，都必须承认这一历史真理。

 2.那场海战使双方都在战斗。 进攻和入侵的一方是中国。 保卫战斗队是西贡陆军的海军。

 3.从所有标准来看，中国军队都是侵略者。 守卫西沙群岛的西贡海军遭到攻击和侵略，因此他们的战斗属于正当理由。

 4.从国际法上看，中国通过捕获而获得“西沙群岛”是非法的，因此，中国自1974年以来在该群岛上确立的主权是无效的。 国际认可。

 5.西贡海军以任何理由被击败，打败和输给西沙群岛的事实必须在越南历史上记录为犯罪，而不是公开。 该罪行类似于安杜昂·旺（An Duong Vuong）的罪行，他因失去了科洛阿城堡，失去了Trieu的奥拉克（Au Lac），失去了Dai Viet的Ho和失去了越南的Nguyen的罪行。

 6.应该承认西贡士兵在那场战斗中的死亡是中国入侵西沙群岛的证据。

 7.最后，应该肯定的是，中国没有历史依据和国际公共法律依据来为其所谓的对西沙群岛的“主权”辩护。 同时，越南从公元前3世纪到现在有足够的历史证据，并为越南对这些岛屿的国家主权拥有充分的国际法律依据。

Yikes you took that honey way too early. It looks like almost all of it is still nectar and has a lot of water in it. You gotta wait till it’s cured in the comb. I bet it still tasted good though. It’s technically not honey though.

"As an entomologist, I am feel shaming with what she did. I am still scared of bees and wasps. I am only brave and to pet a stingless bee species. Another Hymenopteran is a BIG NO for me. I am afraid of their sting. Lucky me, I never get the worst. So, I think she can do many things. She can do anything. As a woman, we should be like her, an independent woman! She is the best entertainer...👏😍"
How old you are?
The distance between her hometown and Changbai is 3000km. She was able to bring back all her stuff fresh and moist, which means probably a day trip.
This is probably the best ad for China's High Speed Rail networks.

So are these product placements for things she’s going to sell? The ginseng honey and the secret sauce? I’d love to try them, but if they’re factory made instead of being done exactly how she does them, not interested.  How to find out?

If I may suggest! All you had to do was cut out honey so you wouldn't take the bee larvae.

Guys, I hope that you can see my comment. I'm here to tell you something about her childhood and now. As far as I'm concerned, her mother passed away when she was little. Soon after, her father married another woman. Her stepmother was mean, she was like every stepmother you've read about in the fairy tales. Ziqi was forced to do all the housework, she didn't even get to go to school usually. Her grandparents were very supportive to her and protected her, they are the most important people to her. Her father passed away then, and Idk what happened to her stepmother after that. She then quit school and came to the cities to work as much as she could to help her grandparents. She has been a waitress, a DJ and all the other stuffs. But then, her granddad passed away, and her grandmother as you all see in the videos was sick. So she quit everything and came back to her hometown to take care of her grandmother although she knew that the finance would be a burden. She then figured out how to make a video. She made the video how to dye cloth by grapes' skin and people love it. She did all the work by herself and try again countless times. One video that is making Chinese noodles, everytime she has set the camera angle, the dough got dry and she cannot use it anymore. So she had to make the dough by scratch again and again to record. The dough that was dry, she then baked them into bread for her and her mother to eat. She then said that she was scared just looking at the bread for a while. When she had some money earned from the videos, she hired some camera men, just 2 or 3, to support her. But the fame and popularity have led to her lack of privacy. Papparazi, fly cams are all over her house, she feels really sorry and somehow guilty to her grandmother because of that. She suggested moving to another house but her grandmother told that she had lived in the house for her entire life, so she wouldn't want to move. Some people may say that the videos are fake, that she didn't actually do what was shown in the videos, she just shows her hardworking hands. She really has had an unfortunate childhood, so she deserves what she has today. Please, if you find my comment interesting, leave a like. This is based on my own knowledge so if I'm wrong, let me know. You can support her by clicking the ads or watching it till the end. Thank you ❤

曾经在农村劳动七年半，所以特别了解农村，了解中国农民的勤劳俭朴，贫穷苦难。今日中国有些村庄依然脏乱不堪，垃圾成堆令人愤怒。

这些不成为否定李子柒视频的理由。我们都明白生活在大山深处四川农村不是简单的田园风光，无忧无虑。

李子柒不是在做大外宣。

她只是想通过自己的劳动创作，挣一份养家糊口的收入而已。我不相信她当初会料到因此大红大紫名扬世界。日进斗金。

有点夸张啊此处[偷笑]

李子柒经历了个人苦苦奋斗若干年，尝试过各种不同工作。她的成功，绝非偶然。

一万个人看她的视频会有一万个不同感受。

我看了，对我最直接的帮助就是突然意识到，自己做菜的水平差的太远。需要更加努力，用心学习。

当然，如同无数粉丝所言，看李子柒的视频，能让人的心，静下来。

很多老外留言说是催眠，治疗失眠症[抓狂][抓狂][抓狂]

更多人赞叹她无所不能。

最夸张的说法是，子柒可以再造一个地球[抓狂][抓狂][抓狂]
I love her and respect her from India
everything is beautiful, love it <3
it goes from a shot of them eating lamb to the cutest lamb ever

搬运自B站热评^_^
I absolutely love how the videos are shot, everything about these videos is ethereal. Thank you for showing us the rural life, as the city life is so toxic and unnatural it's unheathly. This makes my soul feel at peace, I hope I can someday live like this too.
Such an irony in the end where the lamb watches them eating lamb shanks🤣🤣
此女只应天上有
احس بشعور حلوو من اشوف هيج منظر💗
Just eat the snow please
Have been seating here for over two hours, watching your videos.
Mommy cat licking baby dog omgg heart just cant!
I feel really sad that every traditional thing she did was really existed in our daily life even 30 years ago, but today almost everything is industrial, I just wanna thank her for reminding all our precious memories!!!!
Oh wow amazing liziqi❤
*2:43** omg.*
I just love her. 😍
Sooo inspirational!!! 🤤.
ZiQi lives in the province of SiChuan that is known for eating numb-spicy food, especially the hotpot she prepared here. You may wonder why she always add spicy pepper and peppercorn, that is because SiChuan is in the South West part of China and is known for its beautiful scenario, sole origin of pandas and very humid weather. The Chinese believe that moisture in the high humidity air and low temperature will slowly seepage to your joints and cause arthritis and inflammation. The people of SiChuan eat spicy food to help sweat out the moisture within to maintain a healthy body. In addition to the hot pepper, black pepper, SiChuan peppercorn, star anise, she also added ginger to the lamb slices - all of which are considered 'warm/hot' or providing Yang energy to the body. Yang energy or qi improves your circulation and keeps you warm. Just like any river ecosystem, if the water flows you won't have any problem. Stay warm my friends.
That lamb feeding from a bottle, wagging its little tail, and that puppy snuggling with and being groomed by the cats 🥺🥺🥺
大晚上的，看饿了
Watching her makes me feel calm , it's so satisfying
❤ from 🇱🇰 
I want visit to your home
that puppy has a cat mum!!
Heaven on earth ♥
:( this video i saw a sheep last video that they have sheep meat :( and feel sad.
感觉心灵都得到了净化
U really made my day and maintain my mood🌈😊❤️
❤️❤️❤️ from your neighbouring country Nepal🇳🇵 
Keep doing this great job😊
Me: The lamb is soooo adorable! What a tender little baby to have as a pet!
_lamb tenderloin_
Me: Oh...right...tender
*"Lambs are less than one year of age."*
Me: Oh...right...babies


Still looks fantastically delicious hahah
To the person reading my comment "have a great day "♥️
she's eating lamb in front of her pet lamb! 😱
我猜测，那个小羊，最后会被涮掉。
The place where she live is so beautiful
转自李子柒的微博
 繁体字不熟练見諒（薑姜貌似都簡化為 “姜”了）
拍攝時間跨度比蠶絲被那期都長，
從初雪到冬至，
足足兩月余~
銅鍋涮肉小料大的靈魂
四川特產----“菜葉包豆腐乳”
 每年都有做， 今年拍下來了。
今年的冬至好像又比去年冷了些
 屋外寒風咋咋唬吹個沒完！
決定就着銅爐子來上一頓熱乎乎的涮羊肉！
清水一盞， 蔥薑（姜）二三。
高興了你還可以再加幾顆大棗和枸杞。
對！鍋底就是這麽簡單。
這再要說不會做。就真的只有我親手做給你們吃了
  銅鍋涮肉的靈魂是上好的羊肉和小料！
羊肉我就不說了，吃貨都比我還懂。
小料就有講究了， 豆腐乳和芝麻醬是整個小料的靈魂 
一定要放的 當然 還有韭花醬，
再就是醬油 辣椒油 香油 蝦滷油 香菜 
能吃辣還可以放兩顆新鮮小米椒碎 豆腐的做法以前專門拍過，這次簡化。
上次用的新鮮豆子不用泡水這次用的半乾豆子，跑了一天才磨漿。
磨漿 過濾 燒開用幾片白菜葉子去掉豆漿的浮沫 停掉火，緩緩倒入滷水慢點，
 點成后的豆花舀到豆腐架上壓實  
 一定是老豆腐！！！
重要的信息打三個感嘆號！！！
嫩豆腐做不成，我是壓了一整天。
老豆腐切塊放乾淨的谷草上 
 經過10到15天的自然發酵 ，
 豆腐會長出白白長長的細絨毛 不由得狂吼，黴化后的豆腐乳太好看了歐~~
大自然真心神奇。自然發酵比較慢 都得10天以上 ， 
但現在好像有一種藥物， 三天左右都能發長毛。
可拍！！
但是呢，一旦在發毛的過程中 起了很多黑點點，那就是壞了。
不能用了，要丟掉！有毒！！
 所以如果自己做是蠻需要經驗的 
不過你們可以去市場買現成的毛豆腐啊 買回來直接拌調味料。 
發好毛的豆腐拿高度白酒泡一下消毒
 可以增香 殺菌 增加保存時間 。
過酒的豆腐沾上調好的調味粉 ，我這些年做豆腐乳調味粉的方子給你們
 辣椒粉 鹽 陳皮粉 八角粉 胡椒粉 花椒粉 家裏有山奈也會砸些山奈粉進去 
沾好調味粉的豆腐塊，用晾了一個禮拜的菜葉子包嚴實 
放進炒黃豆墊底的缸里  炒黃豆的作用是發酵過程中吸收水份
一層豆腐包一層姜辣子 （薑 鹽 辣椒粉）
最後用多餘的菜葉塞進縫隙撒一些白酒 密封發酵一個月以上 就可以吃了~~~
天寒地凍的，
夾一片新鮮的羊肉 
放進只有蔥薑調味的滾水里涮變色 
沾上秘製的小料塞進嘴裏。
屋外的寒風凜冽又與我何干！
 哦，羊肉是買的來着 
鍋仔還健在
 安心~~~
I always like the background songs she used. Very relaxing.
That looks like the best hot pot OMG <3
I really wish I could help her in anyway.
Did all of u saw that scene when the puppies were sleeping together??? 
Awwww it was soooooo cute
I was so worried that the lamb became the meal for like a good 3 mins until I saw it at the end
最后羊的表情亮了
我大半夜看这个！！！
its my dream "PRINCESS}
I do'nt know why i am watching this with tears in my eyes
People need to stop comparing her and other Chinese YouTubers, there from different regions and all equally important, I love them all❤️ In America we have lots of farm YouTube channels and they all support on another and visit each other’s farms and learn from one another. There’s no competition in natural living. There’s no copying when they share the same culture.
It's impossible to live I like you such a hard worker u our are , love what ever you do
I love that they eat outdoors all year round.
I'd prefer to live there than my house.
I wish I had garden like her😍i will happyyyyy alwayssss
She makes me feel inadequate, but at the same time, motivated. I wanna do better this year.
why the song reminds of stairway to heaven
I love your All videos... it's so amazing 🤗
These videos set off such a primal urge in me. Like this is what God intended for man
你完全让我爱上了你 ❤
I realize some of these clips may have been shot months apart to allow time for fermentation, etc. It's amazing to me. I love the quality content this channel gives.
اللهم بك أمسينا وبك أصبحنا بك نحيا وبك نموت واليك النشور
I love her simplicity
I am so comfort  it is literally asmr video.
I trice to watch you youtube channel its amazing.i amaze everything to what you done your way of cooking your made of sofa..i hope one day will see each other and will come your home..
The little lamb chewing her hair at 4:16 MY HEART! so adorable <3
PLEASE WE WANT TO KNOW ALL THE RECIPES JUST TO DO IT, GIVE US THE DETAILS TO HOW WE COOCK THE FOOD
除了美麗的李子柒及慈祥奶奶, 幾位可愛的汪汪及咩咩也上鏡.
3:06 the cat is licking at the dog
I love your Lifestyle in village i wish i can live like that Away from the  hectic city lives.
I saw a puppy sleeping with a cat and the cat was taking care of the puppy!
Hey love from ❤️I like all ur videos,, specially for the pets u have.. They r too cute n the cinematography n scenic beauty is fabulous 😍
I was wondering what you do, beautiful woman, when it snows? Now I know. You are invincible ...
小羊在吃妳的頭髮啊~😅😅
3:06 guess who is adopted 🤔
Watching her videos like a theraphy or meditation
Dog and cat ❤️
Those "lamb High rib" parts looked like ears...
She lives in such a beautiful place!
I just wouldn't do well freezing all the time, even at dinner.
Everyone says” I wanna live in the mountains like her” but it’s not that easy as making these sentences. True I want it too. But most of them really give up if they go there. Btw your videos are amazing, so satisfying and of course naturally beautiful. Keep going like that. Love from Turkey.❤️
到了天寒地凍的冬季,子柒依舊作日常農事,真的是很勤懇👍👍👍
I repeated 6:32 many times.. 😍💕❤
真的不簡單 ! 點讚 !!
I just found this channel and am so at peace. Thank you.
Soothing, the little lamb chewing on her hairs, the cat adopted the puppy and the food look so tasty.
Fantacy 😍😍❤
Wow, I love watching these videos! Keep it up and keep more coming please. I would just watch these videos all day :D
I really thought about life like this.
I love your videos! I would like to know what's the song's name, if someone can help me here, please, let me know! :)

her petting that lamb at the beginning and then cutting up a lamb later is really mortifying to me for some reason
So peaceful, i wana live here
💕🐾🐏🎋🍲😌✨!
Hermoso todo saludos desde Argentina 🙋💕✨
I started to wonder if she’s a real person?? As she’s just so beautiful and the place is absolutely gorgeous 😍
Que fofura esses animais sempre do lado dela .Essas mulheres guerreiras .
:D Thanks xoxo! :D Even if you cook a lot of meat, I love your videos: D I'm a vegetarian
Her videos are oddely satisfying
I must say I got addict pretty quickly
Oh my god, it reminds me that when I was young, my grandparents also made spicy bean curd paste by themselves, wrapped by cabbage. Now we buy canned bean curd paste from supermarket, but the flavor was not actually the same , so sad, I need to learn how to make this!
Bruh when the caption said “Lamb shanks” had me dead 💀💀💀💀 poor little lamb!
All of ur videos are absolutely beautiful u r my favorite to watch can I come visit watching ur videos always makes me hungry hahahaha thank you so much for all u do

I really want that bamboo tap, it's so cool !
She's brilliant 👏🏼
When she chopping that lamb meat... then at the end there’s a focus on the sheep 😂😂
They should make a movie about you. It'd be the most amazing thing. The creator and writers of Avatar: The Last Airbender (tv show) should do it
Opuppies❤️❤️❤️❤️
I wish we all had this kind of life.

Am I watching a movie ?
Do anyone know the background music used
I have to be honest! I'm jealous! This is how we should be living. Not all this processed crap! I'm sure many will agree.

Sooooo beautiful.. however if i would have eaten that much chilli my stomach would have gone 🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🤬.. love her so much
4:15 that freaking lamb always eating her hair xD
If I could go back in time,in my own life, I think I would choose to live a life as this on,in the mountains,my own food, clean water and air, it is perhaps could be describe as a hard life, especially when there are trouts or whatever, but even we city folk have those problems,I would rather be doing these things then massaging endlessly about nothing ",too much talking leads to sin. "It is so much better to work with our hands ,and heart,in nature.
ya ampun anak anjingnya tidur sama kucing akur banget :)
I want live like her. Thank you for you video, it is so wonderful. Привет из России.
there is no problem re-watching her videos 😍😍
You have realy cute dog ihope you can read this
This is heaven on Earth.
So much joy comes from watching your videos 💖
literally she knows everything.
My wife and me every day watch your video,you are so cute,
Happy new year,
✌✌🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩
Before watching this video, I feel very stressed, but after this ,I feel just like a New born
im scared the lamb at the beginning became her dinner
味噌とチーズの中間みたいな感じかしら？
鍋うまそう
liziqi what you offer us is pure beauty and grace, I want to thank you from  my heart 🌠
and here I was sitting thinking: wait: soybeans can be used to make cheese? and then it hit me: Tofu is soy-cheese! I'm an idiot.
看仙子的视频有一种莫名的感动每次都会不自觉的鼻酸，不是伤心是神往感动和回忆，就像小时候看桃花源记的哪一种感动，也许这就是每一个都市人都向往的生活吧？
Beautiful outside and inside is you miss.L
Wish to know the source of the background music in her videos?!!
We’ve become so removed from living in harmony and close to nature. These videos evoke a deep yearning for a lifestyle that seems so right. Liziqi is showing us how it ought to be.
4:15  这小羊真的可爱死了😂 吃头发
I remember when mum wake me up at three o'clock, to do The same thing she did to get tofu ready for the open market in the morning, hehehe,  hmmm, that was just a beautiful memories.
Mary has a little Lamb

You do an awful lot of work alone. Is there no one to help you?
Liziqi, your videos have become my favorite to watch. I love how you honor the land, the animals, your family and yourself. I'm an American and I grew up with fast and frozen foods, and microwaves. Watching you cook is like going back in time for me. I can't fathom cooking like you do. It's like an artform; a craft. You are beautiful, talented, and marvelous! Quite an inspiration you are!
From Nepal god bless you
OMG lol she did that like she was snapping someone's neck 2:19 
I love her
With love, ... from Romania (Europe)
The man who will marry her in the future is very , very lucky bastard.

Could someone provide me the name of the song?
اللهم انى اسالك رضاك والجنه  المكان ساحر والسيده قمه فى الابداع
I need a whole episode for that mama cat taking care of the puppy 😭
Everything in such a harmony, the cat, the dog, the sheep, the goose and the cow, they just like a big family. I just love the feeling of family hold together in the snowing winter days.
Why aren't we living like this?
You make me want to run away to the mountains
สวยมากค่ะ
Bean curd paste or toufu is really really yummy especially for frozen ones. Dripping with some hot pot sauces.😍😍😍 I'm going to eat hotpot tomorrow
4:16 baby goat chewing on her hair <3

I love how traditional it is. The scenery and mood is absolutely breathtaking.
What a beautiful place and beautiful people there! Love all your videos
The mold on the tofu starting at 2:35 is a little bit concerning for me... how can you make sure it's not one that harms your body?
It's hard for me to believe it's save to eat... 😢🤔
姜文：就是为了这口醋才包的这顿饺子！
李子柒：就是为了这口豆腐乳才涮的这锅羊肉！

Quote from her weibo: the shot in 6:24 aims to tell you that I am not cooking the baby lamb. It is still alive.
It's called life
I addict with your videos..
Amazing.
I dont what people think when they are pressing the dislike button, if would have an option of pressing the like button several times I would press it unlimited times...
Heaven 😍😍😍
She looks like a snow-white with her animal friends

저는 이 영상보면서 힐링하는데
These videos are sent straight from heaven!!
Your video is absolutely feels good and comfortable...I like the way you cook and prepare dishes.Its yummy looks.
そうであっても、人々は-watchingが美しい景色を持っていたが、完全に自然の生活の中で私たちの七面鳥が、ここで忘れている私たちの近所の平和を探すことの文化の一部のセグメントでさえ、今は誰も😊✋
Your pets are so cute😍
Impressive and yummy as a neighbor country. Some ingredient are also familiar to me. Good job!
I like that kind of life which is so peaceful like hers. No polution, problems, chaos, or anything negative. Just a simple living that where it could provide our everyday needs and where peace is at ease. 
😇😇😇

早上好，我来自巴西，我住在一个拥有60万居民的城市，我被这个地方的简朴所迷住，再加上大自然，我的愿望就是进入电脑屏幕并永远留在那里生活。 我想赞扬所有员工：演员，技术人员，非常出色的版本。 谢谢。 抱歉错误，因为我的语言是葡萄牙语。

I want to learn the technique of fermentation and pickling from you.
Saya untuk INDONESIA RAYA KU ya
Whenever I see comments that contradict my point of view, I feel like I wanna argue with that person but I always remember that each and everyone has their own opinions, beliefs, perspectives, and so on... So not to argue with those people is my way of respecting them. 

Spread love just like what this amazing woman does <3 
Have a peaceful and bountiful 2019 to all!
The goat casualy eating her hair
Those who work hard has the right to eat well.
from mixi with love
Aawwwww..that kittyy and puppyy...😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
At first I thought she was making the popular street food “stinky tofu”~ because I know that one is fermented. It turns out she’s making a completely different fermented tofu dish... There are so many different types of tofu i don’t know about. I want to taste them all~😍
Kitty keeping puppy warm and licking its head is so so so adorable!
Is this probably can be heaven ??
👍👍Love From Malaysia 😍😍
❤️
Your videos are art. You deserve more than YouTube channel. You even can have your own TV channel, I think!
Was it a lamb she raised?😳🥶
channel youtube terbaik ..salam dari orang Indonesia, tepatnya dari Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta
정말로 신기한것이
한겨울에 어떻게 싱싱한 채소가 밭에 자라는지???
정말로 궁굼하다
Cuộc sống yên bình đến lạ.
The animal are so cute you are awesome fan from America
So cute when the small goat eating her hair🥰
So cute how the dog and cat is 2:44, 3:07 .They love each other
Chị em có thể sang đó thăm quan nhà chị không ạ
Hermoso paisaje me encanta cosina todo natural
I am just seeing video thumbnail on my gmail then, going through the video and liking the video without seeing entire video. Because I know you never disappoint your viewers and subscribers. Much love from India....:) :)
Pemandangannya bagus banget,pengen rasanya kesana.

كيوت💓💗..
太美丽啦
The heaven for kitchen lovers
I love her videos, but it's way morbid to eat that lamb with a sweet little lamb sitting at their feet...
I loved everything except the eating raw meat part
My love grandma is getting older and older I hope she lives a lot longer for your sake ,and you take such good care of her did she teach you how to do all the things that you know how to do today she’s a wonderful teacher if she did God bless her give grandma a hug and a kiss for me tell her there’s somebody in America that loves her dearly as well💋🌹💕🌹💋💕💋🌹💕💋🌹💕💋🌹🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🇺🇸
Ancient cooking methods wow no artificial methods great i have no interest in cooking before but when I c this channel now I very much interesting to cook channel change my life thank you jaihind 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
被吸引住了。没错，这就是我们中国人的文化，中国人的根。
I was attracted. That's right, this is our Chinese culture, the Chinese roots.
These videos not only inspire me to figure out a way to change my life, but are also better than any antidepressant. For some reason just seeing someone so peaceful and content makes me feel the same way. Also, these videos are super educational, which is mostly why I am always on Youtube anyway.
Everyone love to see those farm animals in a farm, but once meat on a plate then suddenly you evil. Sad really sad seeing some commenters expressed those view.
I am a first timer here. Everytime she did something, I was like wow...wow...wowwww 😱😱😱
Increíble todo lo que hace 👍
So much difficult to do such things... You showed all that this can be done with so much ease.... Thank you... God bless... Keep it up.... :)
I'd say these are the real privileged people. I believe humanity has evolved through the ages thinking that wealth is what makes you privileged, we have forgotten ourselves and our roots have been severed. This woman is a virtuous, hard working, and privileged human who honors her elders.
What a role model she is 💗
볼수록 빠져드는영상입니다.기분좋은영상이에요
리자칠 너무예쁘고 못하는게없네요
你好。 我住了6000公里。 现在在我的国家午夜。 我正在看你视频的十分之一，我无法脱离。 我很高兴。 谢谢
Hello. I live for 6000 km. Now in my country at midnight. and I'm looking at the tenth of your video and I can not break away. I love it. Thanks.
你是唯一的女神，会做饭，会拍完美视频，不做作，不低俗。有的自媒体吃饭狼吞虎咽，你确实自然得体。
Very hardworking gul.ur video realy inspired me.keep it up gul👍🏻👍🏻
好幸福啊，自给自足
I am your big fan..Liziqi😙😘 god bless you
This proves that living a luxurious life isn’t a life goal ❤️❤️❤️
Beruntung banget pasti yg dapetin dia jadi istri ny ,

有一次看李子柒刷牙是横着刷的，我自己因为这样牙龈退缩了， 所以，请博主和其他朋友们小心哦
好棒的影片和地方~

看着她的影片，心情会变得平静，很舒服😌。原来这个世界上还存在着这么美丽的大自然，而不是只有繁忙的生活，工作的压力，。突然我意识到，我这么忙碌究竟是为了什么。
♥️
Đúng cuộc sống thần tiên vô tư ăn toàn đồ ngon sạch nữa

Ước mơ của tui. Thật đẹp
Nhiều người cho rằng Ấn Độ ăn cay , nhưng tôi cam đoan rằng người Trung Quốc ăn cay hơn , nhất là vào mùa thu , đông . Tôi đã coi rất nhiều chương trình ẩm  thực của hai nước nên mới kết luận như vậy .
Wow, I found her channel when she didn't have nearly a third of the subscribers she has today, there were no english comments whatsoever hahashaha, so proud, it's one of my favorite food/chinese culture channel ♡
I pity the little lamp's family :.(

This lady has the true beauty, not fake beauty such as "miss universe" or "supermodel". She is beautiful, hardworking, smart. This channel should be watched by children nowadays.
麻酱！
Love U....
小羊看着她吃着羊肉脑海中的画面一定很丰富~

So relieved to see the lamb at the end! I know we all eat these creatures but when you see them playing and following her the idea she would slice it up is too much.
You are very patient ....good luck....love from india
You make me love cooking more and more everyday... 
Much love from Tanzania,Africa

You can't eat lamb in front of a lamb
為何，總有想要隱居山林的衝動？也許，妳才是最懂得表達幸福的人物，祝福妳，也謝謝妳。
💗💗💗💗💋
❤❤❤❤
Dear Liziqi, I love your videos so very much, unfortunately not all of them, because I am vegan.  I'd like to ask you to do some videos of you making purely vegan foods with all your usual beautiful and delicious looking spices.  This way some of us who are vegans or vegetarians can enjoy your cooking videos completely without having to turn them off half way when the meat comes.   Thank you for your awesome and inspiring videos. You are an amazing and gorgeous little woman.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍👍👍
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Que vida boa no campo🤩
làm cái gì đấy
I love this videos  I'm big fan of you  I'm Indian 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳

What a hard working young woman certainly puts me to shame, such sweet videos with the baby animals. Enjoyed them very much!
Interesting dish. I enjoyed watching this so much, I'm watching it again.
Where does she get all these cool vessels, bowls and barrels? Just one would cost a few hundred dollars. Every utensil she has is hand made.
Is this Paradise ?
Tớ yêu cậu
En voyant une telle beauté, j'ai vraiment du mal à comprendre pourquoi des gens peuvent penser qu'il vaudrait mieux fuir sur Mars...
It would be an absolute dream to  go live here for a few months and help out/learn from you!
I love dis video really very much
so peaful
Wo Ai Ni Chi Chi Beautiful Moment

之前訂閱我柒爺的時候
那時候才30萬人
隨著時間的流逝
現在快200萬了
而柒爺的影片也變多了
看完了新的又回去看舊的
怎麼看都看不膩
柒爺的影片讓我的人生目標多了一項
老了就去隱居
哈哈哈
Had to make sure they showed the baby lamb as proof of not killing it lol for those of you who didn’t watch it there an episode of a chicken cute and all and about a few mins it was dinner lol but I’m just teasing. I love her videos.
فديتج

Poor lamb he will be slaughtered soon for her recipes
Сколько же трудолюбия в этой красивой и хрупкой душе. Вот если бы еще и на русский были субтитры,  было бы здорово.
小羊内心： 这个家恐怕待不下去了
為什麼有按下的，這麼享受的天然食材跟自在，比在都市的紛擾好太多了
She is the proud of us。
Her pet lamb was shookt 😑
👍
I showed my wife.. I asked why she can't do these things.. 

I think I'm sleeping on the couch tonight 😑
Enjoy ☺☺😍
I like your  dogs..

I feel better just by watching this channel , the cancer is faded by the power of Chinese Fairy .
中国最美的风景是人。🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳
腐乳是发霉制作的啊！？再也不敢吃了。火锅很棒，材料新鲜！
💖💖💖😍😍😍🙏🙏🙏
little lamb watching them eat lamb
She has the power to do this on free will many of us cannot keep up such a challenge because our subconscious is so much different in order to live and experience a full life with integrity and happiness we have to start with maintain principles and good habits practice and sets good gold and try our very best to achieve it by making no mistake we have to be strong and try to eat and live a healthy live style.
那只猫竟然舔了一条狗，他们相处的也太和谐了吧
Do y'all think she ate that little lamb?
pure magic
Delicious 😋😋😋😋
i from India and i love your all video .....love yaa liZiqi
子柒姐我来报到了，视频很好看，爱你哦么么哒～
Story of Food
The many dislikes are from the people when were brain washed by their govt/media that their country, culture and food is the best. Every culture is great in its own way , takes time, reading ,travel and a bit of age to realise that :)
Song name ?
🐶🐑🐐😺👍🏽
Watching her videos is always calming for me.. the music is great, video quality is awesome but the best part is the real sounds of nature. City life can be tiring so watching her do things traditionally always makes me happy, I feel like I am actually there.. Lots of love & support to you ❤❤
Wow😍😍
😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍
♥️😍😍😍😍😇👍
这么治愈的视频为什么会有那么多人不喜欢呢，嫉妒她的生活吗？
Watching your videos always makes me feel at ease. I dropped everything when I saw the notification lol
Ai eu cazo kkk
That poor little lamb will be the next victim maybe... 😄
nhìn ngon quá
🇹🇷
I live on the other side of the world, you can not understand how much this makes me dream. Thanks, I love you!   💓

喧嚣中，看你的视频，总是让我认清楚自己改走什么样的路，做什么样的人。谢谢你给我安静的心
https://youtu.be/LOGRHFk-ahw
Wow very nice 👍 food healty
I'm willing to try that tofu, but not if someone tells me what it is first. She literally let it get so moldy you couldn't see it, then let it get even more rotten. Gross dude
Liziqi is my favourite channel of youtube
Who is it behind the camera ? having great filming skills. Who shows her how to cook ? making bean curd ? I wonder .. she seems to master everything at such a young age.
Is there an online source for these recipes she uses within China's internet?
how come sichuan has winter snow?
😍🐩🐱🐈🌳🌿🌾🌻🌺
Здорово,необыкновенно,красиво!!!!! Здоровья Вам!!!!!!
😍😀😁
I like them
how did she use the bean curd paste in the end? I did not see
Que fofo os gatinhos e o cachorrinho juntos!.
I wonder why she prepares everything in large amount? 🤔 it’s only she and her grandma! For whom she cooks in 2-3 huge saucepan
Beautiful videos
YOUR HOME IS VERY COOL
羊儿好可爱，羊肉好好吃😂😂
我是四川人，小时候，我奶奶经常给我们做，现在出来工作很少吃了。

I am a Sichuanese. When I was a child, my grandmother often gave us this food. I rarely eat it when I come out to work.
Am I the only one who don't eat the animals I raised myself.
i love tofu
评论全是老外
VERY HARD WORK GIRL LIZQI
手很凍吧！注意保暖，小動物超可愛
Hehe
Why this place
I for 1 watch these videos in envy wanting to live in that beautiful place and the lifestyle, would give anything
Gosh, everything is so fresh, and those spices made my mouth watering 😋 
I can't handle snow but I want to move there wherever it is 😍💙
小狗兒🐶好可愛！
Wonderful, I love wildlife.
So natural, i love watching this video god bless you keep hard working and one thing u r really beautiful 😘❤️😍😊
😲 😲 😲 really really AMAZING Liziqi , love always for this channel
仙境仙居倩影如仙
居此相伴夫復何求
She’s just like a princess 👸😘😘😘 I love her
Woah, maybe i watch too much of her vids, coz i know that she's making tofu and she's putting leaves on it to remove the bubbles and then ferment it so it will be a hairy one hahahhhhaha
How many hours do u have in a day?? So much of work, yet energetic ♥️
Is this background song a cover of Gene Clark’s Gypsy Ryder?
Love you 🇰🇭🇰🇭
This is so very beautiful. I admire your skill and talent.
How many hours do u have in a day?? So much of work, yet energetic ♥️

can anyone knows the music she used in this video? please i wanna know it's beautiful :<
That baby lamb looking at liziqi eating their cousin or something haha cute tho
I wonder how the little lamb might feel about the lamb rib……beautiful video though. The girl is just a treasure.
บรรยากาศดีจัง อยากไปสำผัสซักครั้ง 😁😁 😮😮 👍👍👍
Beautiful in every way!
很喜歡這樣的生活
Esta bella mujer me enamoró con su belleza y carisma bella ella Saludos.
No words to express my feelings, but I could have seen love affection, nature beautiful country location with this girl and her grandma pets and moreover cooking receipes are really wonderful God bless her👍
I like Liziqi's videos so much. These are so relaxing. My 3.5 year old son is also a huge fan. Only problem I see is with the lamb shanks being cooked on one end and a cute and innocent lamb on the other side. It might become their food for another day. I can't digest that
2:44 my heart 😭♥
Một cô gái tuyệt vời ❤
Liziqi is beautiful ❤️
have a garden of self-cultivation of vegetables and animal husbandry really like, very peaceful
뒤에 어린양고기 나와서 양 죽었나했는데 아니었음 ㅋㅋㅋ
Is this possible? Is this even real? Who's the photographer?
How come things grow there in winter? I mean winter in Slovakia (middle east Europe) is harsh, nothing grows .. This is magical ❤
Hi li ziqi! I'm always watching your videos coz I love the way you cook..😊

Ber ber ber
Everyone saying they want this life . The Environmental beautiful surrounding her is not Easy . The trees the farm the life stalk everything that's beautiful require lots of labour work on a daily basis in order to maintain it.  Laziness will only ruin it . The things she does looks easy on your eye cause she is a professional at what she does . Don't fool yourself inorder to want to live this live it requires certain decipline and Wisdom . Take a first step and keep a pet dog first it will take a toll on you and your responsibility taking care of it . My simple message to you is  the best things in life are the most hardest and most sophisticated thing . Good luck to you all those who live the life of dedication and decipline you are the ones who will succeed on what you set out to do . Thank you people for giving your best.  Live on life it's worth it (it's beautiful)

亲爱的李子柒，
我不认识你。 我没有做出如此荒谬的说法。
我在互联网上观看你的视频和关于你的研究。
我希望我能通过互联网了解你，但我知道这是不可能的。
这些都不能告诉我你是谁。
感谢您分享生活的一小部分。
你是一个了不起的人，一个美丽的女人，一个珍贵的朋友。
才华横溢，干练，独立，有动力。
强大，有创意，聪明。
耐心，温柔和关怀。
亲爱的女士，你是艺术，诗歌，音乐和魔术; 全部包裹在一起。
无论你去哪里或你选择做什么，我都祝你万事如意。
你应该得到一个人可以给予的所有爱和尊重。
如果他们无法珍惜你的身份，那么他们就不值得你注意。
我祈祷你和你的祖母都有长寿，好运，和平，爱和幸福。
我希望你继续做你心中快乐的事。
最宝贵的财富就是你。
感谢您与我们分享您的心。
ชอบก๊อกน้ำประปาดูดีมีเสน่ห์มากๆๆ

This brought me some memories from when I used to help my mom and grandma to do canning. I loved those times and miss them so much. I had a beautiful life in a small town in México, I miss the nature, the animals (riding the horses, watching the caws, goats), the river, my family, and everything..

I got tired of seeing the worldly things where people crave for materialistic things. All I ever see most of the time is how perfect it is to see the world and travel, buy  things and be trendy. Then I found this, a video were you'll feel satisfied and peaceful. Away from the noisy place of the city. That you just have to go back to the nature and see that its enough. Her videos were simply cleansing to the soul. I feel so free watching her, she's awesome!!! 😍
this is like an anime
This girl make me wanna have long hair

I wish someone can give me tittle of this song ...🙏🥰
The great thing about these videos is that it brings everyone together. It doesn’t matter what language it’s in or if she or he relates to it. It’s the natural beauty and aura of what she does. So satisfying and mesmerizing the true history and workmanship it takes to produce what she does. Or hey maybe it’s because she is beautiful
ทำเป็นทุกอย่าง

Very love china

I don't bring subtitles,can somebody tells me what it's written in the title above?
In world of convenience we forget how beautiful it is to work each day for our food. Not in an office but out there as still to this day people do. We are about to do that here where we live. We moved far away from the city. Deep in the mountains we live. It's hard work living up here. It's daily maintenance. I cook for 2 people but sometimes more and that is ALLLLLL DAY to prepare just ONE dinner. I care for anyone who is hungry and share what I can give. I love that we won't have to go to stores for convenience. That we have to work for it, maintain our garden, and clean. We are sooooo much closer, bonded, and getting closer to our community this way. People miss out on the beauty because they don't really take time to embrace it. Sure, a vacation here and there but to truly feel it, you have to live it. God Bless Everyone <3

海浪無聲將夜幕深深淹沒
漫過天空盡頭的角落
大魚在夢境的縫隙裡游過
凝望你沉睡的輪廓

看海天一色 聽風起雨落
執子手吹散蒼茫茫煙波
大魚的翅膀 已經太遼闊
我鬆開時間的繩索

怕你飛遠去 怕你離我而去
更怕你永遠停留在這裡
每一滴淚水 都向你流淌去
倒流進天空的海底

海浪無聲將夜幕深深淹沒

原來你生來就屬於天際
每一滴淚水 都向你流淌去
倒流回最初的相遇

Whats the name of the fruit in this video😮
Quero morar na China . principalmente nesse lugar maravilhoso
Ingin sekali punya rumah d kelilingi bunga dan sayuran serta buah2n....gak prlu mewah tp udarax begitu sejuk dan menyegarkn. Subhanallah😇😇😇😇
I'm glad I can see a beautiful Chinese countryside and traditional life through her videos...but there's more than that. They enlightened me. Lazy person would never deserve the beautiful life like this. She knows everything what she does because she must have learned how to live in the countryside from her grandparents so well. It's not always easy for everybody. I shamed on me so much after watching a couple of  videos. What exactly have I learned in my life so far...? Watching how she spents time on each things, I can't stop feeling that there were more things that I could have done. I really respect her on how she faces her life. I need to do mine too.
وقيل غير انا عربية انا عجبتني بزاف
Chị xinh thế  💝

Wannabe her guest some day in my life

Do you know why it's so relaxing??? It's because there is no plastic and everything is in love with nature..... Even the cheese cloth she uses brings warmth to the shot.....🥰

很喜欢你视频
Clothes making, embroidery, calligraphy, paper making, chef, agriculture, carpenter, craftsman, noodle puller, silk maker, shoemaker, wood printing, dress maker.... Like...
and to top all of that off you're freaking DROP DEAD GORGEOUS?? I just want to give her a big ol' hug and tell her what an amazing person she is
好喜欢这样的生活方式，有时候真的被工作上的压力压到喘不过气，好想从此以后远居山林，过这种自给自足的生活。可能越是这样不可及，越觉得美好吧。哪怕只是几分钟的视频，感觉好像是跟随她在山林里生活了几百年。好美，会继续关注。
Does anyone know ~ are those apricots?
Where does she get the water in the bamboo pipe from??
good luck 
🇴🇲👍
听到溪流声，鸟鸣，公鸡打鸣，闻到淡淡的青草味道。您的视频是喧闹的都市之外的一片净土
Filming is excellent. So peaceful I find her to be extraordinary in her natural beauty. To me this is as close to heaven on earth. Living in an urban American environment I long for this kind of life. But she is mesmerizingly beautiful in all her movements.

You are full of blessings girl. 
Our God is so full of mercy for giving us Mother Nature that gives us so many wonderful things which are so great in many ways yet people are destroying it's beauty. You are an inspiration to me who belongs to one of the remote places here in India. I love my village and I'm going to treasure all the indigenous ways that the village people have. We have very less resources but I'm sure we haven't discovered all the gems of the village. I pray that each one of us take the responsibility to respect the Mother Nature

Я бы не смог принести корзинку с персиками...
Я бы их все съел не отходя от дерева, на котором они растут😀
Персик?
the music is so much better and fits this video more than the animation its from xD
三百万订阅！👍🏻👍🏻😎柒柒牛！
The song at the starts is in on tik tok but anyways love your channel
To all new viewers who think these are staged,  at first I also have the same thought. Then I research about her and I am more amazed to know this is really her daily life and before this, she struggled a lot in her life. To make you more captured,  I watched a clip that shows she also shoots all her video. She is a fairy! A real life one. If you are not convinced,  find her in Google (Li Ziqi).
Quá ngưỡng mộ.
外国朋友们，你们知道她叫醒狗狗是为了漆黑的清晨能给她起到保护作用吗
I love this video very much....  Life without technology. The most amazing life that human life dream. ❤❤❤❤❤
🇲🇽😘💛❤💙💚💕💛

The videos are so calming and inspiring that they have become pieces of art. Ziqi is a true performance artist in some ways, fashion, dressing, cooking but she has managed to integrate as much to her everyday living style. Congratulations Ziqi you have made real changes to many people to rethink their lifestyles in China and around the world - I’m one of them.

This is so addictive!! Been watching your videos the day i found your channel!!! New subbie here :)
Can you guys give an English translated title in the video for people like us who don't understand Chinese.....!
Anyone know the BGM? pls?
Tôi yêu cô bé này
I feels so calm relax and peace just to watch her video...her life is so beautiful💖
Seriously..fed up of some people explaining the hardships and limitations of living in rural areas because some commented that they want this kind of life..come on! They are just appreciating..it just a wish. 
No one said it's easy..and she makes videos about the positive and healthy side of life not about the struggles and limitations of living in a village which is obvious. A little common sense is enough to understand that this is not how daily life looks like and also which is not her point of making all those videos.
Can any one please tell me which fruit is this.is it pitch fruit or not? I am form Bangladesh.
Hello dot and
Is she real? She seems like a dream. Or maybe I died and saw an angel.
These channel is a must

Very nice videos
她到底住哪裡啊~
鄉村生活卻有網絡~
На мою девушку очень сильно похожа внешне только а по навыкам умением и талантам совсем не похожа чесно говоря эта девушка мне очень сильно нравиться
You Plice vare
😍😍😍😍😍💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💕💕💕💕👍👍👍👍👍
I was told the CCP (China Communist Party) sponsors and supports Liziqi's social media content as a way of exporting a better image of China.  Is this true or is she really totally independent?
ضعي ترجمة بالعربية لما تفعلين.
Delicioso me encanta  sus  vídeos
I keep reading these comments on all her videos saying that she’s like an angel that loves nature that respects the earth and everything around her and that she works hard and is very kind but...... DO ANY OF YOU GUYS KNOW HER IN PERSON! You all are fast asuming that she’s some type of angel and you thinking that could possibly be putting pressure on her to keep up that appearance this is just my way of thinking but maybe she’s that way in real life but people put on their best faces on video but could be very different off camera you never know but she appears honest
nice
Receta que solo son receta Pero son la vida de alguien y quisiera ,son lo recetas Pero son la vida de alguien éxito

Girl you do some hard work but I think it’s really great that your keeping traditions going forward. I think we all need to live a little more simple in life
I’m dying to see this place
Was this a farm of the century or it was specifically built for YouTube
This woman is the living representation of my goals in life. Simply put, she's an artisan. A self-sustaining artisan.
I want to live where she live 😀

That melon was really green 💚
I know everything in life requires hard work. Especially when you need all your wits and physical strength to do labor. But I will still say that living in the countryside, simply, with the combination of technology and the indigenous wisdom of the old ways will still provide more peace than being in the city where everything has a price tag. Let's keep the countryside peaceful. Thank you for your videos. It has provided peace and calm to my mind.
Such a wonderful talent she has.God bless her with wonderful gifts
Ava dangdai ve mawle..i've never heard that one could make a tea using the peel of a passion fruit..great vid..

Dari indonesia? 
Adakah?
I watch this video with HARVESTMOON BACK TO NATURE SPRING THEME MUSIC.
因为没字幕显示分量翻到去微博哈哈哈哈哈 And for those who need recipes in English version,here you go~
以下是子柒的原话（中文）：
百香果柠檬蜜，百香果肉挖出来加等比冰糖和柠檬熬到粘稠，放温搅上蜂蜜装起来放冰箱就好了，小火啊各位大锅，小火是多大不知道的小朋友咱们就乖乖去买现成的啊听话、
百香果皮不要丢，切碎烤干就是百香果皮茶了，炖肉放一些也很好哦！
百香果柠檬鸡爪子，新学的网红做法！果然很好次！用柠檬代替传统醋的酸，百香果酸甜提味，小米椒辣的叫！反正就是我小助理一个人吃完了一半！
土豆是黑土豆，种子是去年网上买的，好像这个品种还有个更好听的名字不记得了，也懒得去翻了，今年种的二代种。种晚了没长大，拿来煎着吃正好。蒸/煮熟去皮压扁煎焦撒调料，齐活！
红糖馒头，红枣剪碎放进面粉、酵母、红糖水揉吧揉吧发酵一小时，发酵好揉条切小段蒸熟就好！不能再简单了！
My English is not very well,but I'll try hard to translate. If there is any problem about translation, please tell me, and I'll correct it soon.  
Honey with passion fruit and lemon, remove the pulp of all the passion fruit and add-on the equal mass of ice sugar and lemon, then boil it with soft fire till thick. Place it till it became warm,  add some honey and stir it, then place it inside the fridge.
The peel of the passion fruits please keep it, you can dice it and dry it, and that will become passion fruit tea. You may add some when cooking meat(dried passion fruit peel).
Chicken feet with passion fruit and lemon, please just watch the video😂
Fried black potatoes, steam it/boil it then remove the skin, fry it and add some seasoned as well.
Steamed bun with brown sugar, cut up the red dates and put into the flour with yeast and brown sugar water, then knead it.  After that just place it for fermentation for an hour. Then cut into the small size and steam it!
🤣🤣
Where can we buy that rock sugar????

You remind me of my grandmother, also I’m Korean. The way you cook and harvesting ingredients, and wooden cooking tools, and old kitchen and thus motorcycle, you remind me of my grandma when she was young. Now she live alone in countryside. Next month I’ll visiting to my granny’s home and watching your vid with her. Your work so peaceful and calming my heart.

More work, less talk
Every kind of vegetables and fruits are there wow....
So beautiful gardening.
Love it.
Awesome video😍
I wish i have that kind of living ❤️❤️
I always feel so inclined to like because all her videos look like they take so much work! Not only making the content but filming too! lol
Me encanta como hace todo tan fácil y delicioso 👏👏👏👏👏👏
I just have to say that although the Ziqi's videos are beautiful, stress-relieving, clear and sharp, it makes you feel that she has everything and life is just great.  It is. But this beautiful young lady has a hard life. Just look at everything she has to do to just make a meal.  We all see it. She plants, grows and harvest her own veggies/fruit.  But after all that is done it's time to chop down old stuff and clean up. Then it's time to cook dinner once you've moved all that stuff from where you grew it back to grandma. Are you kidding me?! Slaughters game herself! What we see is when the hard part of the job is over.  Take the fresh fish she prepares and cooks. All in freezing cold weather! Gutting game is no fun task, especially in cold weather.  Everything she does she makes it look easy but it's not!  You rock, Ziqi! The world needs more people like you and you are so special.
All these videos remind me that earth is so beautiful.
man what is that place so much beautiful and the rain I dont have words to describe
Please do a video on how to maintain a beautiful garden like yours I love your garden very much 💞💗💓💖💝💖💗💗💓
I think you are teaching the world Liziqi ! I know I have learned so much. Thank you so much. Where I am from is California. I sure hope you keep posting videos.
More English subtitles please!

I don't thing so you verry good! 
I want do visit there? But i dont known
😮 me pareció ver una linda cosita😍 asombro video
I do wish there were english subtitles so I knew what some of the stuff was. And i know this is purely an american issue but occasionally I can't get past the weird meat choices. Don't get me wrong the dishes look amazing and probably smell wonderful, but the chicken and pork feet creep me out. And also the tendons and duck blood and organ meats.I know it's just not what I'm use to culturally and I would try the dishes at least. Though I think all those red chilis would kill me. Aren't they the really HOT ones? I'm a wuss when it comes to spicey. I find these episodes so relaxing and awe inspiring.
Какая же вы умничка, столько всего делаете и сама. У вас очень красиво, мечтаю побывать  )
你好，我学习中文只是开始一月。我爱你的视频。她是也很美丽

Hello can somebody tell me how good it is? I am learning Korean, mandarin and Japanese. lol in case I have an asian wife

Please make English subtitles.
R.I.P me tomorrow
I am eager to know how she plants and take care a lot of vegetable and fruit like that
Xin cám ơn đã có phụ đề việt ngữ . 👍👍👍㊗️㊗️㊗️
Relax 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I don't know what she make but  I always see this feel good
How could you eat the chicken’s feet??
I don't think there is any man worthy of her. I like how feminine and strong and disciplined  she is
She is free from all artificial cooking style...love u liziqi from Assam (India)
I don't understand eating chicken feet, but the rest looks wonderful ❤️
This is my idea of heaven a beautiful peaceful home, abundant nature, calm beautiful woman and great natural food. Just add good conversation, communication and an array of good books = Perfect
❤
Ver estos videos me hace sentir relajada 😄
您的视频纱丽非常好....

Ở đây cái j cx có nha mn
Có ai là người Việt Nam ko
It looks like they have everything there...they are blessed. How i wish i can live a life like she lived 🙏🙏😘💖
if someone wonders about the chicken paws: chicken paws are widely consumed in whole asia, especially in its villages. western ppl may feel disgusted, but for them its normal food. people from the city dont tend to eat it, because they are used to eat normal meat. i for example ate the lambs feet dish which is made by us east asians, and it really really tastes amazing. if i think now that i ate something which had nails on it once, i choke a bit😂, but it really is delicious
All I gotta say is.......TEACH ME YOUR WAYS OH GREAT GODDESS OF CHINA WHO MAKES GREAT DELICIOUS FOOD
Your videos weather so nice.....
看着好健康好舒服啊 大自然的美丽真是什么都比不了啊
This  totally stole my heart 🤗

This young woman reminds me of my mother... when I was young & we were living back on the islands my mother grew everything & anything except coriander cause she hated the smell.. my mother even grew marijuana plants and used it for trade... when she had traded enough bags of cement... she paved a footpath right around our house!! Even traded for roof tiles... living completely off the land... love these videos!! Very self sufficient...
Her garden seems to have all kind of plants and herbs, so wonderful! Additionally, she's so pretty when working...
